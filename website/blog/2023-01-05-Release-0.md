## Ticket Details
### Chargeback generation fix for empty reports
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
There was a rare issue during generation of Chargeback Statements in case the respective usage reports
had no line items. This led to missing Chargeback Statements. The issue was fixed now so that those
Chargeback Statements will be generated with zero costs.

### New Dashboard in Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The first step of having your cloud foundation at a glance is here: a new menu item in the Admin area called "Dashboard" has been added.
The first version of the dashboard enables you to view general information about tenants, financials, users, compliance, and marketplace.
Please stay tuned, as we will extend this dashboard with more information in the coming weeks & months!
