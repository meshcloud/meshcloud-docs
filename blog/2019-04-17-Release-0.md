## Ticket Details
### PoC for Azure Landing Zone Configuration
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
We implemented a PoC to apply ARM templates to the Azure tenant when creating a new meshProject. This allows
to configure the Azure tenants with company defaults for being company-compliant and to speed up development
by creating default resources like VPCs. Parameters of these templates are also supported and have to be set
by the user during the creation of a meshProject.

### Details about Customer and Project events are now available
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Within the Customer- and Project-History page partner can request the details of a specific event like changed role or similar.

### Replicator handle entity mappings
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** replicator


#### Description
The entity mapping handling of cloud resources to the meshStack business entity is now done on the platform replicator itself.
This increases robustness of the mapping handling if a platform replication takes some time (e.g. on GCP).

### Platform Replicator are now one deployment
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
After more and more platforms are supported by meshStack we combined the replicator into one deployment artefact
to improve the deyploment experience.
