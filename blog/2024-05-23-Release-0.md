## Ticket Details
### Fix platform sign in URLs for AWS, GCP and OpenShift
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A bug in the last release caused meshPanel to no longer use tenant-specific
sign in URLs that redirect users directly into the web console for their cloud tenant.
This affected AWS, GCP, and OpenShift platforms.
This release restores the correct behavior.

### Tenant management for Landing Zone Contributors
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now see and manage the tenant lifecycle of tenants that are created under a landing zone
which you own. This only works if you are setup as a contributor workspace to a platform.
