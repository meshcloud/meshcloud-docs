## Ticket Details
### Import of user groups without members
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** identity connector


#### Description
Customer user group having no members can now be successfully imported via the identity connector.

### Fixes OpenStack projects not replicating if tags are present
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** os


#### Description
Improves replication behavior for OpenStack projects when tags were manually added by someone
to an OS project. Previously such projects had a chance to fail during replication.

### Adding additional project policy checks
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Previously we have introduced the enforcement of meshProject policies during project creation. Now the policies will be also evaluated during meshProject edit, location add/remove and meshUser/meshCustomerUserGroup access control.

### Link payment method during meshProject import
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Payment methods can now be linked to meshProjects using the meshObject API.
Subsequent calls to import the same meshProject will update existing
payment methods with the new specification. If no payment methods are
specified in a meshProject import, the default one will be used.

### Added policy violation overview in admin area
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
If you have setup meshPolicies (for details see the documentation), these policies are
periodically evaluated. If it happens that a customer violates these policies you now get an
overview about it in the admin area.

### Improved visualization of Customer User Group screen
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
Details of user groups and members in user groups are now in a table with extra information.
The screen is also slightly altered to make it more responsive for different screen sizes.

### AWS Acccount Tagging
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
AWS Accounts can now be tagged directly using configurable tags during a meshProject
replication. This helps identifying and organizing accounts based on third
party information.

#### How to use
In order for this feature to be used, the meshfed-service user should be
assigned the permissions "organizations:TagResource" and "organizations:UntagResource".
