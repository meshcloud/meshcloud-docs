## Ticket Details
### Add customers for imported projects to private platforms
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
When projects on private platforms are imported the project customer is now automatically allowed to access those platforms. Previously, it was neccessary to manually give these customers private platform access.

### Avoids re-assigning Subscription Role (Azure)
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Existing role assignments are taken into consideration before an assignment is performed.
This avoids exzessive logging.

#### Description
The administration area now contains a list of tenants with their replication status across all customers.

#### How to use
Open the administration area and click on 'Tenants' in the bottom-left. You can now see each of the tenants
and their replication status which are either 'Failed', 'Successful' or 'Pending'.
