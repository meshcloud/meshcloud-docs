## Ticket Details
### Adds sanity check for import YAML file contents
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Certain unescaped number formats could lead to a faulty parsed YAML file during object import. This
is now checked and will be described by a clear error message during import.

### GITC_PW_ project prefix has been removed
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** config


#### Description
After clarification with the affected stakeholders it was decided, that the GITC_PW_ prefix for project names and
identifiers is no longer needed. Old projects will keep this prefix and will not be touched by this change.
But new projects can now be named freely and don't require this prefix anymore.

### Fixes Azure replication because of unexpected response
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Because of an unusual response from Azure API Azure project replication was failing in certain cases.
This response is now handled correctly.
