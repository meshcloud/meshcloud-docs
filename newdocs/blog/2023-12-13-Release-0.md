## Ticket Details
### Bugfix regarding static Building Block inputs
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
We removed a bug that led to wrong values for static Building Block
inputs in case they were of either type boolean or number.

### Fix stuck Building Block creation
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
We fixed a bug that left Building Blocks stuck in a waiting state
in case the platform tenant id was not available immediately.

### Fixes purging of Instances from private Service Broker
**Audience:** User


#### Description
This fixes a bug which prevented the purging of Service Instances 
from private Service Broker via the recently introduced feature.

### Fix display multiple currencies in Chargeback Statements
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, the chargeback statements, which included CO2 information, displayed the net amount 
for each currency within the scope of the chargeback statement separately, without converting the currency.

### Improved performance of Usage Report generation
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
Generation of Usage Reports for highly dynamic tenants where resources are created
and deleted frequently, did put a high load on the system. This has been improved
to put way less load on the system and to execute usage report generation a lot faster.

### Fixed custom platform replication issue
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
We found and removed a bug that occurred during replication of
tenants from custom platforms, after a custom platform had been
deleted.

### SCIM Performance Improvement for Large Groups
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
We have optimized the SCIM implementation to enhance performance, particularly
when handling SCIM group membership updates for groups with a large number of
members.

### Fix Financials Charts in Dashboard
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
In some cases it was possible to get an error in the Cloud Foundation 
financials dashboard because the platform type could not be set correctly. 
This is now fixed.

### Fix not updating Marketplace Usage Reports
**Audience:** User


#### Description
Usage Reports for Marketplace Tenants were not updated since the Release 2023.26.0. With this release they are now updated again. This only affected the current month of December and once the new release is deployed, marketplace usage reports for December will be up to date again.

### Preselection of Global Marketplace
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
With this change, when you create a project, the Global Marketplace won't be automatically selected 
unless most of the services in your meshStack portfolio are OSB Services.
