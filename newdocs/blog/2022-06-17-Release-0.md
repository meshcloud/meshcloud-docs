## Ticket Details
### Include empty Azure meshTenants in Chargeback
**Audience:** Partner, Customer


#### Description
Recently, a bug was introduced while improving the Azure Metering collection. This bug prevented generation
and finalization of Tenant Usage Reports for Azure meshTenants which have no resources and no consumption at all.
Tenant or Landing Zone Fees should usually be applied to these Azure meshTenants, as these meshTenants still exist.

#### How to use
We have fixed the bug. Now the May 2022 Tenant Usage Reports will be generated again and finalized. As Chargeback
Statements for May 2022 have already been created, these Usage Reports will be put into the June 2022 Chargeback Statements automatically.
Hence, you will see Usage Reports for these empty Azure meshTenants for May and June 2022 in the Chargeback Statement for June 2022.
