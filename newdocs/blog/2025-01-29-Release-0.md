## Ticket Details
### Non Admin Users Can Not Modify Locations Anymore
**Audience:** User


#### Description
As locations are potentially shared between different platform instances the edit right for regular users 
was removed. Locations can now only be edited by admins from the admin area.

### Enhancements to Building Block Definition Creation
**Audience:** User


#### Description
In this release, we enhanced the General tab of the Building Block Definition creation interface. And we added a new input field that 
allows you to select the type of building block. This marks an important step toward supporting workspace building blocks in the future.
At this stage, you can select only tenant building blocks.

### Revised access control search
**Audience:** User


#### Description
In recent weeks, we have added the ability to search for users/groups 
within the access control screens. This change may cause unexpected 
validation errors. The view has been revised and made more robust.

### Fix Boolean Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
When editing building block inputs of type boolean, the default 
value was displayed instead of the actual value in some cases. This is now fixed.

### Remove unassigned users from notification recipients
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator


#### Description
Previously, there were occurrences where users removed from a workspace were still
receiving notifications. Now, users removed from a workspace are periodically cleaned up
from the notification recipients list. This ensures that only users with access to a workspace 
are notified.

### API key row alignment
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We have resolved the alignment of the API key overview rows within the workspace control 
plane. The offset within rows has been resolved. The columns now match the row values again.

### Adding Access Request Rejected to Event Logs
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
Previously when 4-eyes principle was enabled, in rare cases no events were written when an access request to a workspace was rejected. This issue has been resolved, and access request rejected events are now consistently logged.

### Merge Building Block Menus into One
**Audience:** User


#### Description
For a long time there were two menu items in the Admin Area & Service Management Area for managing building blocks
and their definitions. We now merged these two menus and pages into one. This should make it easier to find what
you are looking for.

### Fix SCIM Group Deletion
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
Previously, when you attempted to delete a group via SCIM that is assigned to one or more workspaces, an error occurred, preventing the action from completing successfully. This issue has been fixed.

### API Key read-only Permissions for Workspaces
**Audience:** Partner, User


#### Description
Users can now add a new permission to API Keys to read the workspace that owns the API key from meshObject API.
Admins can add a new admin permissions to API Keys that grants access to list all workspaces.

### Remove Project Deletion Queue
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We have removed the project deletion queue which could be found in the workspace overview under projects -> Deletion Queue.
A while back we introduced visibility of projects that are awaiting deletion directly in the project overview.
This made the deletion queue redundant and we have now removed it.
