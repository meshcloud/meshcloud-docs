For some cloud platforms, administrators can get an overview in the meshPanel of their active and inactive cloud resources. Through our metering process we collect various cloud resources and display these in a table format in the Administration area. This will make it easier to get an overview of what is currently running, and what has run in the past.

To view the cloud resources inventory, go to the Administration Area and scroll down to "Inventory -> Resources". The page will display a table with all known cloud resources. The table can filter on various criteria such as the name, the type and platform of the cloud resource.

As of now, only [OpenStack virtual machines](./meshstack.openstack.inventory.md) are supported. These are provided additionally with their public IP address and flavor name. Feel free to file a [feature request](https://meshcloud.canny.io/feature-requests) if you there are any other resources for other platforms that would be interesting to see in the meshPanel.
