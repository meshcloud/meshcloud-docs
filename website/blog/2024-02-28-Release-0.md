## Ticket Details
### Fixed Broken Login
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, some users experienced issues logging in and 
found themselves in a state where both login and logout 
functions were not working as expected. This was particularly 
problematic for new users attempting to access meshStack for 
the first time. This is now fixed.

### Create an Empty Project
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now create an empty Project without any Platform Service. 
This makes Project creation easier and more flexible, allowing 
you to import tenants afterward efficiently without constraints.

### Don't apply discounts on environmental reports
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
Discounts (or fees), that are applied on usage reports, can be defined in meshStack. If they are
only scoped to a certain sellerId, they were also applied on environmental reports. This is fixed now
and the discounts won't be applied to environmental reports anymore.

### Tenant replication accidentally reported as failed
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
Under rare conditions (often happening when using a custom platform), a previously successful replication
of a tenant was shortly after reported as failed. This was only a display error and has been fixed.

### OpenStack configuration available in self-service
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Platform Engineers can now modify the platform configuration for OpenStack platforms
on their own in the Admin Area.

### Payment Identifier special character regression
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
A recent fix, which fixed payment identifier validation to only allow alphanumeric and
dash characters, affected some meshStacks in a negative way. This relaxes the validation again to
fix the workflow for those affected meshStacks.

### Enable Metering by Default for Platform Services
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
This change enables to setting prices for Platforms and Building Blocks without additional metering 
configuration via pre-configured optimal parameters in the integration configuration metering section.
