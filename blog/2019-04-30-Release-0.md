## Ticket Details
### Metering price catalog auto-updated for marketplace services
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** kraken


#### Description
If an OSB service provides cost information as described in the OSB API profile, the price catalog of the meshMetering component
gets updated automatically with this provided information. This allows service owners to provide cost information of their service
directly in the service catalog and this information is used to create metering information and provide the prices to a billing system.
