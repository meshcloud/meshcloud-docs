meshStack consists of 3 main areas for different roles inside your organization. 

- **The Admin Area:**  
  This area is used by the team who provides Internal Developer Portal capabilities internally to others. The admin area is the central place to set up, customize, and operate your very own Internal Developer Platform via meshStack. From here, we can get a high-level view of all of our resources and events. 

- **The Workspace Manager:**  
  Via the workspace manager, application teams can create and manage their environments. This includes adding and removing services, authorization, and financials for their environments.

- **The Platform Builder:**  
  The platform builder is THE PLACE for platform teams to offer platforms and services (building blocks) to application teams.
