## Ticket Details
### Fixes New SCIM User Login When Manual Invites Are Disabled
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed a regression in user authentication that prevented users from logging in. This issue occurred when a user
was created via SCIM and manual user invitations were disabled in the system. In this scenario, the user could not be
properly matched during login, resulting in authentication failures.

#### How to use
Users created via SCIM can now successfully log in to meshPanel even when manual user invitations are disabled in
your meshStack configuration. No action is required from your side, as this fix is automatically applied.
