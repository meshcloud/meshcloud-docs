## Challenge

Staying on top of platform costs is critical. meshStack’s budget alerts help application teams to quickly react when costs approach or exceed budget limits.

## Prerequisites

- You are a workspace manager or workspace owner in a workspace.
- Your workspace has a payment method with a configured limit.

## Step by Step Guide

### How Budget Alerts Work

- Budget alerts are sent automatically — no setup required.
- You’ll receive an alert if:
  - You’re a Workspace Manager or Owner.
  - Your workspace has a payment method with a set limit.
  - Cloud consumption reaches 80% or more of this limit (e.g., €400 out of a €500 limit).
- Alerts are sent via email on Monday mornings.
- To avoid spam, all relevant budget alerts are bundled into a single email.

Currently, budget alerts and payment method status only consider Euro.

### What to Do If a Budget Is Exceeded

You have two options if your budget is exceeded:

- **Increase the limit of the payment method**: Contact an admin to raise the limit for your payment method.

- **Request a new payment method**: If you need a new payment method, you can request a new one by contacting an admin.
