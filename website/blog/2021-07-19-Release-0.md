<!--truncate-->

## Ticket Details
### AWS SSO Integration
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack now supports an integration with AWS SSO for AWS platforms. Previously you were only able to integrate
AWS by configuring the meshIdB as an IdP in AWS. The AWS SSO integration enables using your enterprise IdP for logging
in to AWS. AWS SSO is a rather new component in AWS and it simplifies the Identity federation. It also improves the login
experience to AWS for end users. meshStack will make sure that meshUsers who are assigned to a meshProject get access
to the according AWS account. This AWS SSO integration will be the new standard integration supported by meshStack.
The meshIdB integration will be deprecated.

### API support for meshTenant Quotas
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
The meshTenant GET API will now include information about quotas that are applied to the meshTenants
either directly or via the Landing Zone. It is now also possible to use the meshObject Import API to
directly specify quota settings on imported meshTenants. The imported quotas will override existing quotas
and missing quota keys will be filled with the Landing Zone defaults.
