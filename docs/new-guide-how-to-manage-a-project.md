> This guide explains how to manage projects in meshStack, including user access, environments, tags, and financials.

## 1. Overview

A project in meshStack represents a logical environment (such as development, testing, or production) within a workspace. Projects help you separate resources, manage access, and track costs for different teams or applications.

## 2. User Access Management

- **Add or remove users**: Assign users or groups to a project to control who can access its resources.
- **Assign project roles**: Set roles such as Project Member or Project Admin to define permissions within the project.
- **Review access**: Regularly review project membership to ensure only authorized users have access.

## 3. Environment Management

- **Create environments**: Use projects to represent different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) for your application or service.
- **Configure settings**: Adjust project-specific settings, such as quotas, tags, and platform connections, to match the needs of each environment.

## 4. Tagging and Organizational Context

- **Apply tags**: Add tags to projects for cost allocation, compliance, and reporting.
- **Tag replication**: Ensure important tags are replicated to platform resources for consistent metadata.

## 5. Financial Management

- **View project costs**: Access cost and usage reports for each project to monitor spending.
- **Budgeting**: Set budgets or alerts for projects to avoid overspending.
- **Cost allocation**: Use project structure and tags to allocate costs to teams, applications, or business units.

## 6. Additional Project Management Tasks

- **Connect platforms**: Link cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) to your project for resource provisioning.
- **Audit and compliance**: Review activity logs and ensure your project meets organizational policies.
- **Update project details**: Edit project name, description, and tags as needed.
- **Archive or delete projects**: When a project is no longer needed, archive or delete it according to your organization's policy.

## Summary

Managing a project in meshStack involves controlling user access, organizing environments, applying tags, and monitoring financials. Use the project management features to keep your cloud resources secure, organized, and cost-effective.
