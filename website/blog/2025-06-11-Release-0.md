## Ticket Details
### Building Block Definition Input Form Improvements
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We fixed a typing issue with the building block definition inputs
form that occasionally occurred e.g. in case strings were used
that contain only digits.

### Partial Role Mappings Now Allowed in Landing Zones
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Before, all role mappings from project roles to platform roles had to be specified within a landing zone. 
Now, you can decide to omit one or more mappings. If a mapping is missing, users with that project role 
will not be replicated, and platform groups relying on those mappings won't be created.

### Building Block Definition Inputs Form Improvement
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We improved the form on the tab for building block definition version input editing
in the panel.
The button for automatic generation of cloud provider credentials now works as expected.
Also, we removed a bug that would occasionally occur when editing multiple inputs at the same time.

### Fixed Email Type Label
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, the email type was always displayed as "string" in the tag overview. This has been updated to "email" to more accurately represent the nature of the data.

### Building Block input type modification support
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now modify the input type of Building Block definition inputs in draft versions. This enables you to change
input types from string to integer, boolean, or other supported types when creating new versions of your Building
Block definitions.

### Project Role Policies
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We introduced policies on project roles. Now you can define which users/groups can be assigned to which project roles. 
This is useful for ensuring that only authorized users/groups can access certain roles within a project, enhancing security and compliance.

### Improvement for Building Block Definition Import
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We improved the import functionality when you add building block definitions
from meshStack Hub to your meshStack. More specifically, numeric values are
now parsed correctly without trailing zero decimals.

### Building Block Definition Import Improvement
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We resolved an issue that would allow users to import 
building block definitions to workspaces they do
not have sufficient permissions for.
