## Ticket Details
### Use in Landing Zone only Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
You can now define a Building Block Definition as an integral part of setting up a new tenant in
a platform by ticking the "Use in Landing Zones only" box. You have to add this Building Block 
Definition to the intended Landing Zones.
This kind of definitions will only be available to application teams as part of a Landing Zone they select 
for their tenant. They will not appear in the Marketplace and can therefore not be added individually 
to existing tenants.

#### How to use
When creating or editing a Building Block Definition, you can set the "Use in Landing Zone only" checkbox,
to restrict the Definition accordingly. This property is not part of the versioning of a Building Block
Definition, so you can change it at any time. Existing Building Blocks won't be affected by this.

### Fix description field in Landing Zones forms in Firefox
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
This fixes the broken description form field for Landing Zones, which was not working in the
Firefox browser.

### Tenant Usage Reports include converted amounts
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
The tenant usage reports delivered by the meshObject API now include converted
amounts, e.g., if an amount is given in USD, the amount in EUR is included
as well.

#### How to use
Tenant Usage Reports now include the additional properties baseAmount (i.e.,
the amount converted to EUR) and baseCurrency (i.e., EUR). All existing
properties remain unchanged. This change is backwards-compatible, so if you do
not plan to use converted amounts, no action is required from your side.

### Fix displaying CO2e emissions in report details
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
This fixes a bug that some Environmental Reports may incorrectly display total CO2e emissions in a details view.

### Admin Workspace Access Overview includes expired accesses
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Now, expired accesses are displayed in the Workspace Access overview in the Admin Area, offering a complete overview instantly. Expired and soon-to-expire entries are highlighted, ensuring easy identification at a glance. You can access this overview under Organization > Workspaces. Choose a workspace and click the users button in the "Actions" column.

### Fix sorting on "Action Required" in Tenants Overview
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, when you tried to sort on "Action Required" in Tenants Overview under Platforms in the Admin Area, you have encountered a loading issue. This has been fixed.

### Onboarding checklist when creating a new platform
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
We introduced a small onboarding checklist that will pop up when you create a new platform in the Admin Area.
It will make you aware of creating a Landing Zone before your platform is ready-to-use.
Stay tuned as we will extend this onboarding checklist with more items that are part of your platform onboarding experience.

### Ops and Onboarding Support can approve tenant deletion
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, users with the role "Ops Support" or "Onboarding Support" weren't able to see the buttons to approve/decline a deletion in the Deleted Tenants view under Platforms in the Admin Area. This has been fixed.

### View Tenant Details for Ops Support
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, Ops Support users couldn't access tenant details by clicking on "View Details" in the Tenants overview under Platforms in the Admin Area. This was due to a loading error that prevented them from accessing the necessary tenant information. This has been fixed.

### Currency Conversion for meshObject API Chargebacks
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
With this change, you will now have converted amounts in chargebacks delivered
by the meshObject API i.e., if an amount is given in USD, the amount in EUR is
included as well.

#### How to use
We use versioning for our meshObject API. If you do not require converted
amounts in the chargeback statements, and you use our API correctly by setting
the Accept header, then no changes are required from your end. If you want to
have converted amounts in the chargeback statements, you have to increase the version
in your Accept header. Simply use the Accept header application/vnd.meshcloud.api.meshchargeback.v3.hal+json
where you have previously used application/vnd.meshcloud.api.meshchargeback.v2.hal+json.
If you are still using v1 (i.e., application/vnd.meshcloud.api.meshchargeback.v1.hal+json)
and you are planning to use the new version v3, please note that v3 (and v2) uses the
term workspaceIdentifier where v1 has used the term customerIdentifier.

### Building Blocks on Tenant Dashboard
**Audience:** User


#### Description
The Tenant Dashboard, which is shown on the Tenant List in the Project Control Plane and on the
Platform Access tab in the Tenant Control Plane now also shows an overview of Building
Blocks in the given tenant.

### Web Console links for Self-Built Platforms
**Audience:** User, Partner


#### Description
A new output type "Sign In Url" was introduced. If a string is returned with
this output type it will be used as the web console link on the platform tenant
dashboard. This mechanism can be used to return per-tenant links to the users.
If this is not set, the web console link is taken from the platform
configuration. This feature allows you to link directly to the tenant in your 
self-built platform.

### Fix Known Host edits for Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
This fixes the sometimes disabled "Known Host" button that prevented changing the
Known Hosts when editing a Building Block Definition draft version.
