## Ticket Details
### Fix creation of new meshTags in Tag Catalog
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
With v7.73.0 an issue was introduced when creating a new meshTag in the meshPanel. After creation of a new meshTag,
the creation and edit screens of the given meshObject did not allow editing tags anymore. This has been fixed now.

### Clean up of deleted tenants
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There were references to deleted tenants in the database which lead to them being charged tenants fees and
landing zone fees. These references have now been removed.

### Resource optimization for data processing
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
There were some billing and metering related database operations which caused high memory consumption on the
database. We have made some improvements to prevent this from happening.

### Filters applied via URL fixed
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It is possible to share URL links of panel components with others in the organizations. The problem of filters in URL
not applying for Payment table and Policy violation table is now solved. This makes working together a little easier.
