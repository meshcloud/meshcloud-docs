## Ticket Details
### Global user groups
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
We introduce user groups that are available on all meshCustomers, called global groups.
Those groups can be assigned to meshCustomers and meshProjects the same way as meshCustomer-bound meshCustomerUserGroups.
Global groups and their members cannot be created and maintained manually or via an API but can only be imported
via SCIM provisioning from an external system, such as an AAD.

### New ability to provide feedback
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
To allow you and your users to provide feedback more easily to the team at meshcloud, we deprecated the old feedback form
at the top of the meshPanel in favor of our new online platform at https://meshcloud.canny.io/ where anyone can publicly share feature requests, and more.
Make sure to have a look at what others have already submitted and feel free to upvote any ideas that you feel passionate about.
You can also open the feedback board via the thumbs up button at the top-right in the meshPanel.

### Updates GCP libraries to the latest versions
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Regular update to the latest cloud platform library version.

### Improved meshTenant replication data structure
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The restructuring of the replication status document will allow easier functionality enhancement in the future.

### Disable Project Creation for Partner
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The project creation functionality for Partners is something we never recommended. With this release it is not possible anymore to create projects as a Partner.
The revision includes several changes in the partners view, the 'Account Area' and items related to partner's own project management has been removed from the screen. The former 'Groups'-Section in the 'Account'-Area has been moved to the Administration Area under 'Partner'.
Additionally, projects are no longer assignable to Partners via the API. If you do want to create projects & tenants as a cloud foundation team, we recommend creating a new meshCustomer for this.

### Customer User Groups moves to new control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The 'Groups' in the 'Account'-Area can now be found in the new customer control plane under the 'Access Control'-tab.

### Partner User Groups moves to Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, you could only find your user groups by navigating to 'Account' and selecting 'Groups' under 'Customer' in the sidebar. Now you can finally access your groups directly under Partner in the Admin Area.

### Active policies in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the active policies page into the redesigned customer entry page. The active policies are no longer available within the account area. If you press the policies sidebar entry then you'll be automatically redirected to the new view. Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### Customer policy violations in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the customer policy violations page into the redesigned customer entry page. The customer policy violations are no longer available within the account area. If you press the policy violations sidebar entry then you'll be automatically redirected to the new view. Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### Payment methods in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the customer payment methods page into the redesigned customer entry page. The customer payment methods are no longer available within the account area. If you press the payment methods sidebar entry then you'll be automatically redirected to the new view. Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.
