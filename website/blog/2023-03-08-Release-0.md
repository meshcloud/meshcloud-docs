## Ticket Details
### Assign multiple Azure Roles to a single meshRole
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Now you can assign one or more Azure Roles to a single meshRole for a more granular permission assignment. 
E.g. meshRole 'Project Admin' can be linked with 'Owner' and 'Backup Operator' Azure Roles. 
This functionality is currently available for Azure Landing Zone role configurations.

### Fixed broken budgeting in some environments
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
In case you are not using paymentIdentifier in chargeback statements, 
assigned costs from usage report were not reflected on the related payment method. 
Therefore, the budget information was not correct. In addition, due to this issue in some cases, 
chargeback statement generation could have failed. This is fixed now.

### Fixes Marketplace showing wrong replication notifications
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
When Marketplace hasn't been integrated with Azure Active Directory, despite its successful replication you saw a notification about pending replication. This is fixed now.

### New Spent Over Time Chart

Tenant Tab, so that you can easier find a needed item.

### Reuse the username of API users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Now it's possible to create a new Api User with the same username as another Api User which 
is already deleted. It's still not possible to create 2 active Api Users with the same username.

### New Marketplace Tab on the Dashboards Screen
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We introduce a Marketplace tab on the Dashboards screen that enables you to
get an overview of all newly created service instances per service name over
time.

### Improved Landing Zones chart on Tenants Tab
**Audience:** Partner<br>

the Tenant Tab. Now even with a large number of landing zones, you have a
clear overview of how many times teams were using a specific landing zone per
month.

### More interactive Cloud Universe

such as dark background and removed scrolling. Moreover, Cloud Universe fits now screen size.

### Searching through Cloud Universe
**Audience:** Partner<br>

A cloud universe can be very large however you are able to search
for specific projects, customers, and users to overview connections 
between needed items.
