## Ticket Details
### Building Blocks Success Notifications temporarily disabled
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We have temporarily removed the notification functionality related to succeeded building block creations. This decision was made to address feedback about the distracting nature of these notifications. We are working on a refined solution that will allow users to specify recipients of notifications, ensuring relevant updates are communicated in a non-intrusive manner. Thank you for your understanding as we improve this feature to better meet your needs. Stay tuned for updates on the improved functionality!

### Enhanced Role Recertification Experience for Access Control
**Audience:** User


#### Description
In this release, we improved visibility for expiring roles on the Access Control page. Expiring roles now have clear visual cues, Yellow highlight 
for roles expiring in less than 30 days, Red highlight for roles expiring in less than 7 days, and Black highlight for expired roles.

### Show Configured Support Links in Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
The configured support and documentation links for regular users are now
shown in the admin area settings panel. This helps admins to verify those
links.

### Warns if Landing Zone Building Block Misses Local Id Output
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
If you create a landing zone for a custom platform it is required to have a building block 
which will provide a local id of the created tenant as an output. Now there is a warning if
no such building block was selected.

### Fix Terraform Building Blocks PATH
**Audience:** User


#### Description
Previously, when providing inputs as environment variables during execution, the PATH variable was not included in the environment setup. This omission could result in errors with certain Terraform functions that rely on external executables, such as Git. This is fixed now.

### Configure Message of the Day in Settings
**Audience:** Partner, User


#### Description
Admins can now set a "Message of the Day" in self-service from the Admin Area -> Settings page.
When activated, this message will be displayed on the workspace control plane for all users. 
Admins can use markdown for rich formatting.

### Improved Review Screen for Tenant Movement
**Audience:** User


#### Description
In this update we improved the review screen for tenant movement to ensure a more comprehensive review process during tenant movement. The tenant 
movement review screen now includes additional information about tenant usage report, policy violations, and user access.
