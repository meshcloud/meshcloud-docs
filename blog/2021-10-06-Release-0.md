## Ticket Details
### Detailed user information
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
There is a new screen that shows detailed information for a selected user, for example, the e-mail, the last login date
and all the meshCustomers the user is assigned to. The screen can be reached by clicking on the name of a user within the
user list in the administration area.

### Logs failed replications due to seq. number
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
If a replication fails early due to a mismatch in the replication sequence number
this information is now properly propagated to the meshPanel for faster troubleshooting.

### Fix Access Denied error when importing meshServiceInstances
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When importing meshServiceInstances, an inconsistent authentication session was generated, which resulted in an access denied error if the JSESSIONID that was returned in the first response is used for the next call. This is now solved.
