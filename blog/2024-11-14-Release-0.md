## Ticket Details
### Fix Deletion Mode Update in Pipeline Automation Definition
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When updating the deletion mode from 'Purge' to 'Delete Resources' in a Building Block Definition of type 'Pipeline Automation,' an error persists, preventing the update even when a destroy file is present.

### Fix Building Block Definition Update to Pipeline Automation
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We have resolved an issue where an error message, "Implementation Details missing," appeared when changing the implementation type of a Building Block Definition to "Pipeline Automation." This error no longer occurs, ensuring a smoother and more reliable experience when updating your Building Block Definitions.

### Removed Workspace Alias in Create Workspace Wizard
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
meshStack Enterprise included an option to set an alias for "Workspace" 
in the Create Workspace Wizard. This feature was removed in this release and
the wizard now consistently refers to the workspace as "Workspace".

#### How to use
The original intent of the alias was to provide better guidance to application 
teams when setting up a workspace in accordance with the rules of their organization.
However we found this feature was not widely used and the inconsistent terminology
introduced by the alias is causing confusion with application teams.

### Fix Landing Zone Creation of Custom Platforms
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, after you created a new custom platform, the platform was not automatically pre-selected on the landing zone creation screen, preventing you from creating a landing zone immediately. The workaround was to refresh the page to make the platform selectable. This has been fixed.

### meshObject API meshBuildingBlock status codes changed
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have made minor changes to HTTP response status codes returned by the meshObject API
endpoints for meshBuildingBlock to improve consistency with the behavior of other endpoints in the API.
Please review the details of this release note for the specific changes.

#### How to use
The API operation POST /api/meshobjects/meshbuildingblocks now returns a 201 status code
when creating a new meshBuildingBlock. Since meshStack v2024.29 this operation started
returning a 200 status code. This release reverts this unannounced change.

The API operation GET /api/meshobjects/meshbuildingblocks/{id} now returns a 403 status codes
when the API key making the request does not have access to this building block. Previously, the operation
returned a 404 status code.

Please note that this change is introduced without an explicit change in the API version for this endpoint.
API clients that strictly check the exact status code (e.g., 201 vs. 200) for these operations might observe 
this as a breaking change. In general we advise that API clients be as lenient when parsing API responses,
for example, by checking for success (2xx status code) instead. 

We do consider making status codes part of our versioning policy going forward to avoid potential breaking changes
for clients.

### API Key Admin Permissions for Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Admins can now add new admin permissions to API Keys that grant access
to list, save or delete Building Blocks in any workspace.

### Fix Azure Geo-Replication Cost
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, meshStack did not process Geo-Replication bandwidth costs for
Azure correctly, which could result in the reported costs being lower than
actual. Our initial findings indicate that the cost items that have not been
processed correctly include only very small amounts.
We will reach out to every customer impacted by this to elaborate on
this issue.
Please note that this fix requires a migration which will temporarily remove
all Azure cost items from non-finalized Tenant Usage Reports of the current
month. This is a transient issue that will resolve itself within less than 24
hours.

### Clean up non-finalized Preview Chargebacks
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change, we introduce a mechanism that regularly removes Preview Chargeback Statements from past periods in case
they have not been finalized. For example, not finalizing a Preview Chargeback Statement can happen if the underlying
usage reports cannot be finalized due to some collection issues. In those cases the Preview Chargeback Statements
should be deleted, as the usage reports will be part of an upcoming Chargeback Statement once the usage report is finalized.

### Workspace Access Count Not Properly Updated
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the workspace access user count 
display from updating properly when a new workspace was created.

### Allow login even if tenant replication fails
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This improves the login behavior when a tenant replication signals a failure. As long as the user's login information
on the project is present (e.g. from a previous successful replication) a login is now signaled as possible.
This should more often allow the users to access a cloud tenant even if there is a replication failure
at the moment.

### Reorder Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
As an owner of a building block definition you can now change the order of the
inputs by dragging and dropping them in the Inputs section of the
building block definition page. By doing so, you will influence the order in
which the inputs are shown to end users when adding a new building block.

### Beta Move Tenants Between Projects
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
As an admin you can try a beta feature to move tenants between projects. You can move the tenants within 
the same or even to another workspace. Please read the limitations and movement info in meshStack carefully!
You can also reach out to support@meshcloud.io for getting support when you want to move a tenant with support.

#### How to use
A tenant can be moved in the Admin Area when you open a tenant and go to Settings -> Move Tenant. This feature 
is only available for environments using the new chargeback process. Moving a tenant may disrupt IaC or API 
setups, as the old tenant identifier contains the assigned workspace and project.
These identifiers will need manual adjustment until API and Terraform provider updates are released to use 
the new, workspace/project-independent identifiers.

### Restricted Landing Zone Permissions for Admin API
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When creating an API user, admins could assign the permission "Allow using restricted meshLandingZone in meshTenant Import".
This release removes this dedicated permission to simplify the permission model, as this is considered an admin operation anyway.
All API users with the permission "Allow to import unmanaged existing tenants into meshStack" or "Import any supported meshObject" can now use restricted landing zones.
API keys with the permission "Admin: Create and Update Tenant in any workspace" can also use restricted landing zones.

### Improved Selection of API Key Permissions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating or editing API Key permissions, meshPanel now groups and
consistently sorts the available API Key permissions. This simplifies
browsing the growing amount of available permissions and selecting the
right ones for your API key.

### GitHub tenants
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Tenants of GitHub platform type are now correctly listed 
in the admin section of the panel as well as on the tenant control plane.
It is now also possible to provide a platform tenant id as output
for building blocks on GitHub platforms.

### API Key Admin Permissions for Tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Admins can now add new admin permissions to API Keys that grant access
to list, save or delete Tenants for any workspace.

### meshObject API meshTenant status codes changes
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have made minor changes to HTTP response status codes returned by the meshObject API
endpoints for meshTenant to improve consistency with the behavior of other endpoints in the API.
Please review the details of this release note for the specific changes.

#### How to use
The API operation POST /api/meshobjects/meshtenants now returns a 201 status code
when creating a new meshTenant. Since meshStack v2024.29 this operation started
returning a 200 status code. This release reverts this unannounced change.

Please note that this change is introduced without an explicit change in the API version for this endpoint.
API clients that strictly check the exact status code (e.g., 201 vs. 200) for these operations might observe 
this as a breaking change. In general we advise that API clients be as lenient when parsing API responses,
for example, by checking for success (2xx status code) instead. 

We do consider making status codes part of our versioning policy going forward to avoid potential breaking changes
for clients.
