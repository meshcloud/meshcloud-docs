### Makes GCP Billing data collection more robust

#### Description
This change ensures that GCP billing data collection will not collect the same record twice, even in the case of failures.
As an example , if the data collection fails due to a network failure, the next collection will make sure to remove any
half collected data from the failed execution, so that there will not be any duplicated records.

The 'Qty' column has been divided into 'Quantity' and 'Unit' for tenant usage reports and detailed tenant usage reports.

### Improved GCP input validation

A malformed GCP folder id setting in GCP Landing Zones could lead to failed replications. 
Improved input validation avoids this problem now.
