## Ticket Details
### Fix for Building Block Definition Form
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue with the building block definition form
that would confuse values within the list of notification subscribers.
The subscribers are now correctly set and updated on save.

### Dropped Constraints for Landing Zone Updates
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We removed the constraints that previously prevented you from changing certain landing zone fields after creation. 
You can now update fields that were previously considered immutable, giving you more flexibility when managing 
your landing zones. This change applies to landing zones on AWS, Azure, and Azure Resource Groups platforms. 
Please note that modifying these fields is likely to cause problems with the replication of existing tenants.

### Building Block Definition Input Improvements Now Available in Prod
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have enabled the improved building block definition input editing experience in prod 
environments. It was already available in QA environments for 2 weeks.
These improvements increase reliability of the building block definition management. 
Nothing should change for you, except for some edge-case issues that were present 
before are solved now.

### Improved Transparency for Draft Building Blocks in Landing Zones
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack now shows a clear warning when draft building blocks are used in landing zones. This improves transparency
around product limitations and helps you avoid misconfiguration.

### Admin-Level Building Block Definition Permissions for API Keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
API keys can now obtain admin-level permissions for building block definitions. This change allows you to create
API keys from within the admin area that have permission to create, read and delete building block definitions from
all workspaces.

### Fix Building Block Definition Tag Updates Via API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, updating building block definition tags via the meshObject API was not possible. PUT requests on the
building block definition endpoint ignored the tags field, making it impossible to modify tags through the API. This
issue has been fixed and you can now successfully update building block definition tags using the API

### Metering Configuration for meshPlatforms via meshObject API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now support metering configuration for platforms managed via the meshObject API (v2-preview version of 
meshPlatform). You can configure metering settings for AWS, Azure, GCP, AKS, Kubernetes, and OpenShift 
platforms directly in the platform definition. This includes settings for data processing, access 
credentials, and platform-specific metering options like cost filters and fair chargeback for reserved 
instances.

### Quickly Send Communications to Platform and Building Block Users
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've improved the platform and building block management experience by adding quick-actions in the overview tables
in the admin area and platform builder. Platform engineers can now send communications directly to users of specific
platforms and building blocks.

### Azure DevOps Support for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now use Azure DevOps pipelines to implement building blocks. This integration allows platform teams to
leverage their existing Azure DevOps infrastructure and pipelines for automated building block execution.

#### How to use
To use Azure DevOps for building blocks:
1. Create an Azure DevOps integration in the meshPanel with your organization details and Personal Access Token
2. When creating a building block definition, select "Azure DevOps" as the implementation type
3. Configure your organization, project, pipeline ID, and execution mode (synchronous or asynchronous)
4. The building block will trigger your Azure DevOps pipeline and monitor its execution status 

The Personal Access Token requires 'Build (read and execute)' permissions to trigger pipelines. Building block 
input data is passed to your pipeline as variables and can be accessed in your pipeline YAML configuration.
