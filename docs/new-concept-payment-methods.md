title: Payment Methods
---

Payment methods in meshStack define how costs for cloud resources and services are allocated, billed, and tracked across workspaces, projects, and tenants. They enable organizations to manage financial responsibility, cost allocation, and chargeback processes in a multi-cloud environment.

## What is a Payment Method?
A payment method represents a way to pay for cloud usage, such as a cost center, internal billing account, or external payment instrument. Payment methods are typically configured by administrators and can be assigned to workspaces, projects, or tenants.

## Key Features
- **Cost Allocation**: Assign payment methods to workspaces, projects, or tenants to ensure costs are tracked and billed to the correct entity.
- **Chargeback**: Enable chargeback processes by linking cloud consumption to specific payment methods.
- **Multiple Methods**: Support for multiple payment methods to reflect different organizational structures or funding sources.
- **Integration**: Integrate with external financial systems for automated billing and reporting.

## Managing Payment Methods
- Administrators can configure available payment methods in meshStack settings.
- Users with appropriate permissions can assign or change payment methods for their workspaces, projects, or tenants.
- Payment methods can be updated as organizational needs change.

## Best Practices
- Use clear and consistent naming for payment methods (e.g., cost center codes, project numbers).
- Regularly review and update payment method assignments to ensure accurate cost allocation.
- Integrate payment methods with your organization's financial and reporting systems for transparency.
