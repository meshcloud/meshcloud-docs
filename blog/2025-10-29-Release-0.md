## Ticket Details
### Optional Filters for meshProjectBindings API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We made the query parameters 'workspaceIdentifier' and 'projectIdentifier'
optional for the meshProjectBindings read API.

### Fix Non-Admins Receiving E-mails Intended for Admins
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where non-admins received e-mails about 'Service Approval Requested' notifications. These e-mails
should only be sent to users with admin permissions who can actually approve or deny such requests. The issue
occurred when users previously had admin permissions but later lost them. Now you will only receive these
notifications if you have the necessary permissions to act on them.

### Service Instances Are Now Visible in Workspace Overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now see Open Service Broker (OSB) service instances alongside other workspace resources like projects, 
tenants, and building blocks in the workspace overview. Service instances are displayed with their managed service 
name, service plan, and current status. This provides better visibility into all resources within your workspace.

#### How to use
Navigate to your workspace overview to see service instances listed with other workspace resources. You can search 
for service instances by name, service plan, or managed service name. Click on a service instance to navigate to 
the marketplace tenant's service registry overview page where you can manage it. If a service instance has a 
dashboard URL, you can access it directly through the "Service Dashboard" link in the overview.

### Fix User Search in New Admin Area Access Control
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixed an issue where searching for users in the new admin area's access management interface was 
failing with an error. Users can now successfully search for and add users to workspaces in the 
admin area using the new access management interface.

Note: This new access management interface is only available for selected customers.

### Fix for Race Condition Leading to Inconsistent Tenant States
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed a rare race condition that could occur during tenant replication updates. In rare cases, this issue could
lead to tenants not being properly updated or deleted, causing them to remain in an incorrect state (e.g., a
tenant that should have been deleted remaining active in the system).

### Enforce Tag Validation for meshObjects Created via API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, a principal with admin permission was able to create meshObjects with invalid tags via the meshObject API.
For example, in a meshStack where a workspace tag named 'environment' was set up to allow only the values 'dev' and
'prod', you were able to create workspaces tagged with an environment of 'qa' or any other arbitrary value. This has
been fixed for meshWorkspaces and meshProjects, so that proper tag validation takes place for these two entity types.

#### How to use
If you rely on the old behavior due to existing API integrations, you can re-enable it via a setting in the Admin
Area. Go to Settings -> Compliance -> Tags to revert to the previous behavior if needed.

### Improved Error Handling for Building Block Run Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the handling of internal race conditions which reduces
seemingly "stuck" Building Blocks.

### Improved User Deletion with SCIM Synchronization
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue that prevented user deletion when both an active and disabled user with the same username existed
in the system. This scenario commonly occurs when SCIM synchronization is enabled. Now, user deletion correctly
targets only the active user while preserving the disabled user record.

Additionally, when you attempt to delete a user while SCIM synchronization is enabled, meshPanel now displays a
warning that the deleted user is likely to be recreated automatically during the next SCIM sync. We recommend
deleting users directly in your source directory instead to prevent automatic recreation.

#### How to use
When deleting a user in the Admin Area > Users section, you will see a warning message if SCIM synchronization is
currently enabled. This helps you make informed decisions about user management and understand that the deletion
may not be permanent if the user still exists in your SCIM source directory.

### Purge Tenants in meshStack
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now purge a tenant to remove it from meshStack's control without executing deletion steps in the cloud platform. 
This is useful when a tenant has been manually deleted in the cloud or when you want to stop managing a tenant in 
meshStack without affecting existing cloud resources. This feature is available to workspace owners, platform operators, 
and users managing platforms via Platform Builder.

#### How to use
Navigate to the tenant settings page in the Admin Area or Platform Builder. Under the "Purge Tenant" tab, 
you will find the "Purge Tenant" option. This allows you to remove the tenant from meshStack without triggering 
any cloud platform deletion steps.

### Administrative Unit Support Enabled For All Customers
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The Azure Administrative Unit features are now available for every customer.

### Simplified API Key Login with Direct Token Response
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We added a new way to authenticate with your API key that returns the access token directly in the response, without
requiring a redirect. You can now send your API key credentials as JSON to the `/api/login` endpoint and receive the
bearer token immediately. This makes it easier to integrate with the meshObject API, especially for clients that
cannot handle HTTP redirects. The existing form-based login with redirect is still supported for backwards
compatibility.

#### How to use
Send a POST request to `/api/login` with `Content-Type: application/json` and include your API key credentials in the
request body as a JSON object with fields `clientId` and `clientSecret`. The response will contain the `access_token`
and related fields directly, which you can then use as a Bearer token in subsequent API requests. Check the API
documentation for detailed examples and response field descriptions.

### Fixed Email Notification Links for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Email notifications for building blocks now link to the correct panel view based on building block type. Previously, 
notification emails linked to an outdated route that no longer existed. Now, workspace-level building blocks link to 
the workspace building blocks view, and tenant-level building blocks link to the tenant building blocks view, ensuring 
operators can quickly access the relevant building blocks requiring attention.

### Add README Support for Platforms
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Platform engineers can now add a README to their platforms using markdown format. Like the README for
building block definitions, the README is rendered on the marketplace and makes it easier for your users
to understand how to use the platform effectively.

#### How to use
When creating or editing a platform, you will find a new README field in the platform settings. You can use
markdown syntax to format your README with headings, lists, bold text, links, and other elements. The editor
provides a live preview so you can see how your README will look.

### Retired meshObject Endpoints deprecated 2025-07-01
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This release removes meshObject API endpoints originally deprecated 2025-07-01. These endpoints now return HTTP 406
(Not Acceptable) with a deprecation notice directing you to the current supported API versions. 
This affects the following meshObject versions: meshTenant v1 and v2, meshProject v1, meshPaymentMethod v1 and meshServiceInstance v1.

#### How to use
If you are using any of the retired endpoints, you will receive HTTP 406 responses.
The deprecation notice in the response will indicate the recommended API version to use instead.
If you need assistance with the migration, please refer to the meshObject API documentation or contact our support.
