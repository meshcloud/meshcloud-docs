## Ticket Details
### Property based guest user detection for AAD IDPs
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** web


#### Description
When an AAD is used as an upstream IDP, meshstack can now be configured to use a property in order
to detect and flag a newly invited user as a guest user in meshStack.

### Substitute payment method for project
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Now you can select a substitute payment method for a project on the edit project screen.
A job that runs daily will check if the currently active payment method is expired and if it is, will replace that
with the substitute payment method. An example use of this feature is to make sure that the project will have the correct
payment method assigned when the selected payment method expires at the end of the year.
Note that this feature needs to be enabled via msehStack configuration.

### External user ID translation per platform
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
External user IDs (euid) identify users to systems external to meshStack. It's now possible to
change euids (e.g. by appending a domain) for different platforms if euid formatting is not
uniform across all platforms.
