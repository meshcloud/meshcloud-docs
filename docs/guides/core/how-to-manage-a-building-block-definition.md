title: How to Manage a Building Block Definition
---

This guide explains how to manage building block definitions in meshStack, including creating, updating, versioning, and deprecating building blocks for automation and standardization.

## What is a Building Block Definition?

A building block definition is a reusable template for automating resource provisioning. Platform teams create and manage these definitions in the platform builder. Building blocks can be workspace- or tenant-scoped and support various implementation types (manual, Terraform, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD).

## Creating a Building Block Definition

1. **Navigate to Platform Builder**: In meshPanel, go to the Platform Builder area.
2. **Add New Building Block**: Click on "Add Building Block Definition" or similar.
3. **Configure Details**:
   - Name, description, and type (workspace or tenant).
   - Specify dependencies if needed.
   - Choose implementation type (manual, Terraform, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD).
   - Provide scripts, modules, or workflow references as required.
4. **Save and Publish**: Save the definition. It becomes available for use in workspaces or tenants as configured.

## Updating and Versioning

- **Edit Existing Definitions**: Update scripts, modules, or documentation as requirements change.
- **Versioning**: Create new versions to introduce changes without disrupting existing building blocks. Maintain backward compatibility where possible.
- **Deprecation**: Mark outdated definitions as deprecated to prevent new usage while maintaining existing deployments.

## Managing Dependencies

- Define dependencies between building blocks to ensure correct provisioning order and configuration.
- Review and update dependencies as your automation landscape evolves.

## Best Practices

- Use clear naming and documentation for each building block definition.
- Regularly review and update definitions to reflect best practices and security requirements.
- Test new or updated building blocks in a non-production environment before rollout.
- Set [run control policy](../../concepts/building-block.md#building-block-run-control) appropriate to the shared responsibility model of your build block.
