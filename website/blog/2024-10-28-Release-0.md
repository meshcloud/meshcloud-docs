## Ticket Details
### Event Logs for Tag Definitions
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
meshStack now records event logs for any changes to Tag Definitions.
Administrators can review these changes in the admin area.

### Improved input/output type checking for building blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've improved how type mismatches between parent and child building blocks are handled. 
Previously, if a child building block depended on a parent's output, but the types didn't 
match, the child would get stuck. Now, the system clearly indicates which parent building 
block failed, making it easier for operators to diagnose and fix the issue.
