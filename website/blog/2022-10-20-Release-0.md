## Ticket Details
### Fix loading project access requests
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The 'Access Requests' on the project control plane was in a permanent loading state. This has been fixed.

### Renamed Danger Zone to Deletion
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We renamed the Danger Zone to Deletion in the customer, project & tenant control plane, so you can find deletion functionality more easily.

### Search for tenant ID in Deleted Tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now search for the tenant ID of a deleted tenant or a tenant that has been submitted for deletion by navigating to the Admin Area > Platforms > Deleted Tenants.

### Fixed landing zone creation
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the last release, we released a bug that prevents the creation of landing zones. This is now fixed.

### Fix meshTenants deletion state filtering API
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When filtering on meshTenants with an 'ACTIVE' deletion state in the meshStack API, the response included meshTenants that belong to a deleted meshProject. Those tenants should therefore also be deleted and they should not appear in the response. This is fixed now.

### Fix SCIM API group member synchronization failing
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
In some cases the SCIM Group Member synchronization could fail which would result in 
missing addition or removal of group members. This is now fixed.

### Collect unmanaged tenants for GCP
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Unmanaged tenants are now collected and shown in the Admin area
for Google Cloud Platform.
