## Ticket Details
### Fixes AWS user permissions for multiple meshRole mapping
**Audience:** User, Customer


#### Description
This fixes the regression that was introduced with v1.160.0: If an AWS Landing Zone mapped
multiple meshRoles to the same AWS Role it broke the user permission assignment process.
This left some users without access to the affected tenant in AWS.

### Fix in the Tenants section of the Admin Dashboard
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Both charts in the "Tenants" section of the new dashboard in the Admin Area previously
were lacking labels on the x-axis. This has been fixed, so that all labels are
visible.
In addition, the column width in the "tenants per month and platform type"
chart has been increased.
