## Ticket Details
### Improves logging for Service Broker communication
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
OSB-specific headers added to Service Broker related HTTP requests are now always logged.

### Adding yourself to customer updates navigation bar
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When you add/remove yourself to/from a customer, the customer dropdown in the navigation bar at the top did not contain this customer and required a refresh of your browser. This has been fixed.

### Fix customer owners not seeing replication information
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If you are a Customer Owner you could not see the replication status of your tenants in the project control plane.
This is now fixed.

### Project caching improvement
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We've introduced the project control plane during the recent weeks. We now did some improvements in the background as a preparation to also make tenants of projects you are not assigned to accessible via the control planes. As a result of this refactoring you will now also see a loader when the project control plane is loading.

### Tenant session improvement
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We improved the tenant session handling in the background. If you are still logged in after the new release has been rolled out and detect any unexpected error, please do a page reload in the browser.

### Use multiple billing accounts in GCP billing data collection
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
meshStack collects data from GCP billing export to BigQuery in order to generate usage reports for the GCP platform.
In BigQuery, the billing export is partitioned by a column named '_PARTITIONTIME'. We use this column to limit the
amount of data meshStack reads at a given time to reduce the read costs incurred when collecting data.
Some of our customers have multiple billing accounts associated with a single GCP meshPlatform. This means that
we have to collect data from multiple BigQuery datasets to generate the usage reports for such a meshPlatform.
This can be done by creating a single view in BigQuery which contains the same columns as a GCP billing export
and is a union of all the datasets. But columns that start with an underscore, like _PARTITIONTIME are not allowed
by GCP BigQuery, so this column would have to be mapped to a different name like PARTITIONTIME. Because of this reason
we made a change to meshStack GCP billing component to make the partition column configurable, so that we can successfully
collect billing data from such a 'union' table.
With this change, meshStack is now capable of considering data from multiple billing accounts when generating the usage
reports for a single GCP meshPlatform.

### Pending Access Requests moves to project control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
You can now find the pending access requests for your project under 'Access Control' in the 'Access Requests'-tab.

### Approve Access moves to customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
You can now find all pending access requests for all of your projects under 'Projects' in the 'Access Requests'-tab.

### More informative message on GCP role assignment error
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
During GCP tenant replication, when assigning roles to a newly created group, GCP sometimes responds with an error
"One or more users named in the policy do not belong to a permitted customer.", which resulted previously in a failed
replication with a generic user message. With this change, we inform the user about the possibility of this being
caused due to the newly created groups not yet being visible to GCP IAM, and request them to try again after some time.

### Fixed deep links into partner area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Deep linking into a specific admin area page (e.g. by bookmarking the pgae) did not work if you haven't been logged in to
meshPanel before accessing the link. This has been fixed now.

### Throttling parallel collection of metering data
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The high number of integrated meshPlatform instances in certain meshStack installations resulted in many
metering data collections being run in parallel. This caused a high load on the database, which sometimes had an impact on the
meshStack performance. The meshPanel performance was also degraded in such cases. With this release, we have introduced
a throttling mechanism to ensure that only a limited number of parallel collections can run per platform type. With
this we will control the load on the database and ensure that the performance of meshStack does not degrade due to the
integration of a higher number of meshPlatform instances.

### Tenant ID for AKS Tenants is now shown
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the Tenants overview in the Admin area the Tenant Id was missing for AKS based Tenants.

### Tenant control plane integration
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the tenant control plane with all related child screens. Platform Access related screens like CLI Access,
Service Users and other platform-specific screens are available in the "Platform Access" tab of the tenant control plane.
Usage Reports are located in a separate "Finanicals" tab of the tenant control plane. The header of the tenant control
plane contains all relevant information of the tenant like its platform tenant id or the assigned landing zone.

### Project access control in project control plane
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the project access control page into the redesigned project page. The project access control is no longer available within the manage project area. Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### Template engine for replicator configuration
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
A powerful template engine allows simpler and more unified string replacements for the replicator
configuration strings. A unified set of placeholders can now be used in an easier templating format
to configure certain string patterns, like Azure Subscription names.
For more information please check the public documentation: http://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.replication-configuration.html#string-templating.

### Increased supported length for service description field
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There are three description fields that can be specified in the Open Service Broker service catalog.
They are service description, service plan description and service plan cost description. Previously, meshStack
supported a length of 256 characters for the service description and service plan description and a length of 5000
characters for the service plan cost description. This caused errors when parsing the service catalog if the description
was longer than what was supported. This has been changed to support 65,000 characters for all three description fields.
While we have made this change to ensure that the catalog is always up-to-date on meshStack, we recommend you to limit
the information that you put in the description so that it is easy to read and quickly understand the content.

### Badge also shows project bindings that expire soon
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
With the new look and feel of the customer control plane we introduced a badge showing the number of expired project access roles.
This number now also includes the number of project bindings that are expiring soon.
This should help you become aware of any project role bindings that will expire in the next seven days.

### Better mention customer name restrictions
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The name of a meshCustomer can be any length and contain any characters.
This information was not mentioned anywhere in meshStack.
To resolve this, it is now explicitly mentioned in the API docs & in the customer creation wizard.
