## Ticket Details
### Filter User/Groups During Project Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this release, the list of users and groups is now prefiltered during project creation based on tags assigned 
to the project. This enhancement applies when access policies are in place that restrict certain types of users 
or groups, helping ensure only relevant options are shown.

### Updated meshObject API deprecation timelines
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have removed the deprecation timeline for meshBuildingBlock v1 and meshTenant v3.
We will announce deprecation dates for these APIs only once the next version of these APIs come out of preview.

#### How to use
Check the API documentation for announced deprecations and timelines.

### Removed "Add Myself" Button
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The Add Myself button has been removed from project and workspace creation to simplify authorization flow. Users 
can add themselves with their intended role via the Add Users button. The user creating a workspace will continue 
to be automatically added as a Workspace Owner.

### Hides disabled landing zones by default
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Landing zones now have a 'Status' column. Disabled landing zones are now hidden by default in the UI.
Users can still view disabled landing zones by enabling the "Disabled" option.

### Sensitive File Inputs for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
There was a regression issue where FILE inputs for
building block definitions could not be made sensitive
when creating or updating building block definitions.
This has been fixed.

### Fixed GitHub App PEM file handling
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Newly Created building block definitions using GitHub App PEM files no longer fail at the "Trigger Github Action" step.

### Fix API Key Sorting by Workspace Name
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, sorting API Keys by their workspace did not work correctly. This
has been fixed.

### Migrated GitHub Integrations
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The GitHub Actions integration used to be managed via Platforms.
This has now been migrated to the new Integrations feature which is
more isolated to and easier to manage. This also has the added benefit
that you can directly create the integration when you create
a new building block definition.

### List of integrations
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The recently introduced GitLab integration and also the migrated GitHub integrations
are now visible in one list in the Admin Area & Platform Builder. In an upcoming release
we will also add the ability to create and edit integrations on this screen.

### Fix API Key Sorting by Creation Date
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, the panel returned an error when sorting API keys by their
creation date. This has been fixed.

### Fix euid filter for meshUser endpoint
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, the euid filter of the meshUser endpoint of the meshObject API
did not work correctly. Instead of returning only users with a matching euid,
all users were returned. This was fixed.

### Tag Catalog Support for Users and Groups
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now define tag schemas for users and groups in the tag catalog. This enables you to create policies that 
enforce access rules for users and groups based on their tags, providing better compliance to your teams.

#### How to use
Navigate to the tag catalog in the administration area to create tag schemas for "User / Group" entities. Once 
defined, these schemas can be referenced in policies to create rules that automatically apply to users and 
groups based on their tag values. Note that user and group tags continue to be managed through the existing tag 
configuration and API.

### Enforce User/Group Policies during Project Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We enabled the project role policy evaluation during project creation. If a policy is
defined between a project role and user/group then assignments can only be made to
users/groups to the project if the relationship is compliant.

### Improved User Authorization for Creation Flows
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we have redesigned the authorization flow to provide a more intuitive and efficient experience 
during workspace and project creation. Highlights include a streamlined dropdown interface, user-friendly role 
and expiration date pickers. This UI overhaul preserves all existing capabilities while improving usability 
and reducing friction during workspace and project creation.

### Admin Area Button Stays White When Focused On
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The Admin Area button in the context navigation now maintains its white background color when focused on.
This update enhances visual consistency and improves user experience by preventing the button from turning black during focus states.

### Add Location Name In Platform Filter
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The location field has been added to platform filter in communication creation to improve platform identification.
This change addresses issues where multiple platforms had the same name.

### Deprecated Platform Notification Subscriptions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The legacy platform notification subscriptions have been removed in user profile section. 
Users will no longer receive notifications through the old system, and all 
notifications should now be managed through the new Communication Center.

### Deprecated Legacy Platform Notifications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Legacy platform notifications have been deprecated and replaced with the Communication Center. 
When admin users attempt to send notifications to users through the legacy interface, they will 
now be shown a deprecation notice and redirected to the new Communication Center.

### Deprecated Legacy Workspace Messages
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Legacy workspace messages have been deprecated and replaced with the Communication Center. 
When admin users attempt to send messages to workspace users through the legacy interface, they will 
now be shown a deprecation notice and redirected to the new Communication Center.

### Accessible Label For Main Navigation Bar
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To support assistive technologies, like screen readers, 
we have added an accessible name ('Main Navigation') to the main navigation bar.

### Accessible Name Now Matches Tag Expand Button Label
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To support assistive technologies, like screen readers we updated
the visual name of the "+ more" tags expand button to match the accessible name.
This change ensures that screen readers announce the same text as what is visually displayed.

### Fix Disabled Save on GitHub Building Block Definition
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If you change the implementation type to 'GitHub' in your building block definition while deletion mode was set to 'Purge', you face an issue where the save button becomes disabled, preventing you from saving your definition. This issue has now been fixed.

### Fix Building Block Deletion Failure
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, deleting a building block failed when a communication that
targeted this building block had previously been created in the Communication
Center. This is now fixed.

### Improved Accessible Labels for Project List
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To support assistive technologies, like screen readers, we now use the project's name 
as the accessible label for project links in the workspace project list, replacing the generic "project".

### Fix false unsaved changes popup for GitHub definitions
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Fixed an issue where an "Are you sure you want to leave and discard changes?" dialog would incorrectly appear when switching tabs (e.g., from Implementation) in Building Block Definitions of type GitHub, even if no edits were made or the version was already released.

### Self-service customization of email style
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Platform teams can now configure the appearance of automatic emails sent via meshStack. 
This feature allows customization of sender information, logo, footer, and action buttons 
to match branding requirements. It ensures that communications look official and recognizable.
A live preview helps validate changes before they go live.

### Partial Role Mappings Now Allowed in Landing Zones
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Before, all role mappings from project roles to platform roles had to be specified within a landing zone. 
Now, you can decide to omit one or more mappings. If a mapping is missing, users with that project role 
will not be replicated, and platform groups relying on those mappings won't be created.

### Building Block Definition Inputs Form Improvement
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We improved the form on the tab for building block definition version input editing
in the panel.
The button for automatic generation of cloud provider credentials now works as expected.

**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We extended the project role to support tagging. You can now add tags on the project role create/update screen.
This is a prerequisite for supporting policies on ProjectRoles. Stay tuned for more updates.

### Fix Access Restriction of Service Binding Endpoint
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have fixed a security vulnerability where workspace members 
could access the service bindings of service instances in 
projects of the same workspace they were not assigned to. 
This update ensures that service binding access is now strictly 
limited to members explicitly assigned to the relevant project, 
strengthening project-level isolation and access control.

### Fix Building Blocks List in Admin Definition Control Plane
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, the 'Building Blocks' tab in the building block definition control plane displayed incorrect results, showing all building block definitions. This has now been fixed. The tab now correctly shows only the building blocks related to the building block definition.

### Fix User Permissions Input for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Building Blocks on tenant level support 'User Permissions' as input.
The underlying type has recently been changed to be 'CODE' instead of 'LIST'.
This led to problems during execution of existing building blocks. 
We fixed these problems so meshStack is now capable of handling older versions
of building blocks that still use the 'User Permissions' input with the deprecated 'LIST' type.

### Fix Building Block Input Regex Validation Not Saved
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
A regression from a recent rework of the building block definition form introduced a problem 
that could prevent proper editing and saving of an existing regex validation for an input

### Refactor meshCommunication object
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API has been adapted by moving the reference of communication definition
from the metadata to the spec of the meshCommunication.
Since the meshCommunicationDefinition API is still in a preview stage, this
change was introduced without introducing a new version. For more details
about our versioning concept, please refer to the Versioning section in our
meshObject API documentation.

"more menu" (three dots) via Tab and using it via Enter.

### Building Block Code Input Type
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
We introduced a new input type for Building Blocks that may represent complex
values such as lists, objects, maps etc. A text editor is added to the panel that 
allows proper text formatting.
The "User Permissions" input source for Building Blocks will now also be of this
new input type.

### Project Role Self Service
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have extended the project role overview page to include the ability 
to create, update and delete. This will allow users to manage their 
project roles more effectively and streamline the process of creating 
and deleting configurations.

### Show Correct Target for Communications
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when creating communications that targeted tenants or building
blocks, only the associated workspace of that tenant or building block was shown in
the panel, but not the tenant or building block itself. This has been fixed,
so that the real target is shown in the panel.

### Markdown Support for Communication Center E-Mails
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
E-Mails that are sent after a new communication was created inside the
Communication Center are now formatted with Markdown support.

### Remove displayName from meshCommunicationDefinition Request
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API has been adapted by removing the displayName from the
payload of the meshCommunicationDefinition. The displayName property was
identical to the communication title, so the removal was done to simplify the
usage of the API.
Since the meshCommunicationDefinition API is still in a preview stage, this
change was introduced without introducing a new version. For more details
about our versioning concept, please refer to the Versioning section in our
meshObject API documentation.

### Fix Building Block Definition Creation with Parents
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
This fixes a regression that was introduced by the introduction of multi-selection inputs in the last release
which broke the creation of building block definitions with a parent relationship.

### List managed building blocks via meshObject API
**Audience:** Operator, User<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API for Building Blocks version v2-preview has been
extended in a way that you can now list Building Blocks that were
created in other workspaces as long as you are the owner of the used
Building Block Definition.
There is a new permission for API Keys for managed Building Blocks
in order to do so. Please refer to our API documentation for required
query parameters on the respective endpoint.

### Multiselect for Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** Customer, User<br>

The selected values are handed over to Terraform building blocks as a list of strings.

### Keyboard Navigation for Profile Menu
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Users can now access and operate the top right profile menu via the keyboard.

### Communication Center E-Mails include Workspace
**Audience:** Customer, User<br>

#### Description
E-Mails that were sent via the Communication Center now also include the
workspace name, so that users that are assigned to multiple workspaces
immediately see which workspace this communication is related to.

### Show Communications for Workspace-Level Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when a communication was created and a workspace-level building
block was selected as target, the communication was not shown for the recipient in the
panel. This is now fixed.

### Assign Communications to their Correct Workspace
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, communications created via meshObject API that targeted a tenant or
a building block were always associated to the workspace that was
associated to that tenant or building block during the time of the creation
of that communication. Therefore, a communication remained in its old
workspace if the tenant or building block was moved to another workspace.
This has been fixed. This fix is also applied to previously created
communications, therefore, if a communication was created and the targeted
tenant or building block was moved to another workspace prior to this fix,
then this communication is now moved to the correct workspace.
This problem only existed for communications created via meshObject API, not
for communications created via the panel.

### Fix DELETE meshUser API when SCIM enabled
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
meshStack v2025.17 introduced an unintended change that would start rejecting

#### Description
The e-mail notifications that are sent out when a tenant must manually be
deleted have been slightly revised. From now on, if the tenant deletion was
requested due to the project being deleted, then the e-mail includes a text
to inform about this fact.

### Introduce Communication Center to Platform Builder
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The communication center is now available in the platform builder. This
allows platform teams to communicate with other teams inside their
organization, for example, to announce maintenance windows or feature
deprecations.

### Add missing Filter Option on 'Aborted' in Building Blocks
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The status 'Aborted' is correctly displayed in building blocks view but was not available as a filter option. This option has been added now.

### Warn Users about upcoming Group Binding Expiration
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, notifications that warn users about the upcoming expiration of
their workspace role have only been sent if that role was obtained via a user
binding. This has been adapted so that users are also notified if they've
obtained the role via a group binding, i.e., if they've been added to a group
and that group has been given access to the workspace.

### Project Role Overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've added a project role overview page to settings > management within 
the admin area to get an overview about all existing project roles.

for managing building block definition versions, but this will follow soon. 
The endpoints remain in preview mode for now. Future changes might still occur.

### Admin Role Renaming
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To improve clarity and remove confusing terminology, we have updated several admin role names in meshstack. The following role names have 
been updated:
- Partner Admin > Organization Admin
- Partner Employee > Organization User
- Platform Operator > Platform Engineer
- Controller > FinOps Manager
These changes are now reflected in the Admin Access page, including dropdown menus and all associated tabs.

### Restrict meshCommunication API for workspace-scoped API keys
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API for creating meshCommunications has been adapted such that
platform teams can only create communications for entities they are responsible
for. This means that the following restrictions now apply when communications
are created via workspace-scoped API keys: When the target kind is
meshBuildingBlock, the targeted building block must be based on a building
block definition which is located within the platform builder of the
workspace of that API key. Similarly, when the target kind is meshTenant,
then the tenant must be associated to a platform that is located within the
platform builder of the workspace of that API key.

### Fix empty Static Input Variables in Drafts
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you created or opened a draft with static input variables, the form doesn't load correctly. This prevents you from saving the draft until the inputs are manually re-entered. This issue has now been fixed.

### Allow tenant move if tenant of same platform is deleted
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now move a tenant to a project with the same platform as long as the existing tenant has been fully deleted. Previously, the move blocked all tenants from the same platform, even those that were already deleted.

### Fixed workspace targeting in notifications
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Resolved an issue where the workspace targeting filter was not applied correctly. 
Notifications now respect the selected workspace(s) and are only delivered to the intended recipients.

### New meshTenant API version
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
In order to fully support moving tenants to other projects, we introduced a new API version v4 for meshTenants.
With this new version, meshTenants are identified via their UUID, instead of the tenant name as it was before.
This change allows us to move tenants to other projects without the need to change the tenant name for API calls.
We also improved some other aspects of the meshTenant in the API. You can check how the new version looks like in 
the API docs. Please make sure to switch to this new meshTenant version, if you are using the meshTenant API. 
Otherwise you may run into issues, when you also use the move tenant functionality.

### Allow Due Date Changes to Published Communications
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Users can now update the due date of published communications. 
Changes are applied instantly across workspace and admin views.

### Fix AWS Tenant Deletion For Unexpected Account IDs

view. Showing the description helps understand the meaning of a particular input field when a
user later edits it.

### Improved Cooldown Handling for Notifications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that could, for certain message topics, result in notifications getting re-sent before
their intended cooldown period was over. This resulted in an unexpectedly higher notification frequency.

### File Type Removed as User Input from Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
It was sometimes possible to choose file type as user input for building blocks.
This is not supported and did not work. The option should not have been selectable but it was 
under certain circumstances.
If you have already created a building block definition with such a combination please create 
a new version of it and fix this input type.

### Allow Title and Content Changes to Published Communications
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Users can now update the title and content of published communications. 
Changes are applied instantly across workspace and admin views.

### Broken Open Source Information in Panel

### Fix Multirole Mapping for GCP Landing Zones
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes the regression which was recently introduced and broke
the configuration of multiple GCP role bindings for the GCP landing zones.

### Communications can now target Tenants and BBDs
**Audience:** Operator, Customer<br>

#### Description
Communication definitions are no longer limited to targeting workspaces. They can now also target specific building block definitions and tenants. This enables more granular communication scenarios, such as platform-specific announcements or messages directed at affected tenants. By decoupling communications from the workspace level, this change supports greater flexibility in the meshObject lifecycle (e.g., tenant or project migrations, deletions, or tagging-based targeting).

#### How to use
When creating a communication definition, use the filter criteria or API to specify target building block definitions or tenants, either by UUID or by tag. The system will resolve and create one communication per resolved object. workspace ownership is still inferred indirectly via the selected object.

### Improved Error Handling for Github Building Block Runner

Such SSH keys are now automatically formatted correctly. This change only applies to newly uploaded keys.

### File Inputs Overwrite Files for Terraform Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
File inputs now replace existing files in Terraform building blocks.
This can be useful in cases where the same Terraform module is used for multiple
building block definitions and part of the configuration must be adapted for each one (e.g. provider settings).

### Allow User Deletion for Non-SCIM Users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously all user deletion was disabled when user management was done via SCIM.
With this change, you can delete users again who are not managed via SCIM even if SCIM
is enabled.

update accordingly. This is now fixed.

### Allow changes for building block multiplicity
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously it was impossible to later change the multiplicity of a building block
assignment from 'Multiple' to 'Once'. Now this setting can be changed at any time.
Please keep in mind that meshStack will not enforce any actions to existing building blocks
when a 'Multiple' building block gets changed to 'Once'.

### Tenants Column on Project Overview
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have added the tenants column back to the project overview in the admin area.

### Import Building Block Definitions From meshStack Hub
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now directly import building block definitions from our new meshStack Hub (hub.meshcloud.io) into your own meshStack. Simply open up a building block definition of choice, click "Add to meshStack", enter your meshStack URL and you will be redirected to import the building block definition.

### Mention Workspace Owner in Role Expiry Mail
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The workspace owner(s) are now mentioned in the mail when your workspace role is about to expire. 
This should make it easier to identify whom to contact in case you are a workspace member

showing them side by side in a single line, they are now presented 
more clearly making it easier to distinguish between name and identifier.

### Tenant reuse protection removed
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With the latest version of the billing system, tenants can be reused without causing data artifacts.
The tenant reuse protection was therefore removed.
This means cloud projects not deleted in the cloud can be imported again to be used inside the 
same or a different workspace.

### Fix missing event log for communication definition
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when a communication definition was deleted, the entry in the

### Fix for rare tenant deletion failure
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a rare race condition that could lead to a tenant not properly recognized as deleted and showing
up as a seemingly failed replication.

### Fix for Copying Truncated Tag Values
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when attempting to copy a truncated tag value (with ellipsis), only the truncated value was copied, not the complete one. This issue has been resolved. Now, when you copy a tag, you will get the full, complete tag value instead of the truncated version.

### No service configuration possible while creating a tenant
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that could prevent the configuration of any service during tenant creation
while a building block definition with a single version was pending approval for this platform.

### Fix selecting all for building block bulk operations
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
This fix addresses an issue where the "Select All" checkbox in the building block
bulk operations did not function correctly. It did not consider the context it was
in. So e.g. instead of only selecting all building blocks of the currently open building
block definition, it considered all building blocks the user has access to. This
is fixed now and only the intended building blocks are considered.

### Improves Behavior for Draft Landing Zone Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When you added unreleased building blocks as mandatory or recommended on a landing zone and are a user of a
owning workspace you can now create tenants with this landing zone via the panel without an error.
Regular users outside of the owning workspace can continue to create tenants in this landing zone
without the draft building block until it is in a released state.

### Show Only Open Communication Items
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The number on the badge now shows only the open communications.
This ensures users have a complete overview of important updates 
and information without needing to navigate elsewhere.

### Distinguish between Different Communication Types
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The workspace area has been updated to distinguish between "Action Required" and "Notification" items.

### Hides Non-Published Building Blocks in Marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the "related" tab of the marketplace view users outside of the provider workspace 
could see (but not use) unpublished building blocks. Now you only see those building blocks 
if you are a user in the owning workspace of the definition.

### Clearer error message when Terraform cannot be parsed
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When creating a Terraform building block definition, if the Terraform code cannot be parsed,
an unclear error message would pop up. We have improved this error message and made it more clear
that even though an error occurred, you can still continue the building block definition creation process.

### Improved Sorting for User Lookups
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the relevance sorting when adding users or groups to your workspace.
This should help to find the right user or group quicker.

### Improved filtering for meshBuildingBlocks API
**Audience:** Operator, User<br>

#### Description
We improved the filtering options for the meshBuildingBlock API v2-preview.
The endpoint remains in preview mode for now. Future changes might still occur.

### Sorting of Communications by sent date
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The communication list in the admin area now defaults to sorting by the "Send On" date, 
showing the most recent communications at the top. This change enhances usability by making 
recent items easier to find and reducing the need for manual sorting.

### Searchable Global Groups
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We added a search field to the global groups overview in admin area.
This allows you to search for global groups by name or identifier.

### Added missing columns to the chargeback statement export
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
To be compliant with the public API, we've added the two missing 
columns "baseCurrency" and "baseNetAmount" to the CSV export of 
the chargeback statement.

### README Support in the Marketplace
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Platform teams can now provide a markdown README for building block definitions. This README is useful for providing usage instructions and other relevant information to users. Platform services built using Open Service Broker API can leverage the new README section in the marketplace via the 'longDescription' field of the OSB Catalog.

### Fix Enabling Due Date for Notifications
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
There was an issue where a due date could be retained when switching the communication type from "Action Required" 
to "Notification" in the Communication Creation Wizard.
This fix ensures that when the type is changed to "Notification", the due date field 
is hidden and any previously set due date is cleared.

### Fix Azure and AKS platform config save problem
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that broke tenant replication based on a 
broken platform configuration on

### User With Controller Role Now See Financal Tab
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Users with the controller role could not see the "Financial" dashboard tab in the admin area.
This has been fixed.

### Add support for workspace level to meshBuildingBlocks API
**Audience:** Operator, User<br>

#### Description
We created a new version (v2-preview) for our meshBuildingBlock API which allows
you to manage both, workspace level building blocks and tenant level building blocks.
This is a preview version and subject to change until it leaves the preview phase.

### Fix Sorting of Communications
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the recently introduced Communication Center within the Admin Area,
sorting communications by their confirmation status or their resolution date
previously resulted in an error. This has been fixed.

### Fixed import validation for meshWorkspaceGroupBindings v2
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The declarative meshObject import did apply a less strict validation to
meshWorkspaceGroupBindings v2 objects compared to the imperative meshObject API endpoints.
This release of meshStack aligns this behavior. As a result, you may now see
meshWorkspaceGroupBindings v2 objects rejected from declarative import when an equivalent
role binding for a role-principal combination already exists.

### Updated LDAP Identity Connector meshObject API version
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The LDAP Identity Connector has been updated to use the latest version of 
meshObject API to keep it ahead announced deprecations. Please see the details of this release note for more details.

#### How to use
The LDAP Identity Connector now uses the following meshObjects:
- meshUser v2
- meshWorkspaceGroupBinding v2 
- meshWorkspaceUserGroup v1

### Exclude partner workspaces from communication creation
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Communications are now only created for non-partner workspaces when no specific workspace is targeted. This prevents unnecessary communication entries for partner workspaces.

### Payment Method Workspace Preselection
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We now pass the workspace information to the payment 
method creation page to pre-select the workspace. 
This is useful for affiliates who want to create a 
payment method for a specific workspace based on the 
workspace filter.

### User enabled/disabled event
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The event related to user was enabled/disabled was missing. Now 
we create an event for the specific action.

### Prevents Toggling Sensitivity for Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
This disables the toggling of the sensitivity level of building block inputs.
Toggling it was not supported and lead to an error upon saving.

### Building Block Output Mismatch Can Cause Runs
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
A bug in the output handling of building blocks could cause unexpected building block runs if the 
outputs of the Terraform execution did not match the outputs defined in the building block definition.

### Page Title Accessibility Enhancement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we have implemented dynamic page titles across meshstack to improve accessibility and user experience. Users 
can now easily identify which page they are viewing through the browser tab title.

### Restrict meshServiceInstance creator via meshObject API
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have restricted the use of the "admin@meshcloud.io" system user in the "spec.creator" field of a meshServiceInstance.
This change prevents new service instances from using this user. We have updated our API documentation accordingly.
Please review this release note for more details.

#### How to use
The purpose of the "spec.creator" field is to control which meshStack user gets passed to an Open Service Broker 
as the "Originating Identity" via the "X-Broker-API-Originating-Identity" header.
API Users were allowed to specify "admin@meshcloud.io" as a "spec.creator" value in the past and we included this as
an example in our API documentation.
We have also removed the "admin@meshcloud.io" system user from the user list of the admin area.
Internal system jobs running inside meshStack continue to use the "admin@meshcloud.io" user to record event logs.

### Workspace Building Block as Dependencies
**Audience:** Partner, Operator, User<br>

#### Description
You can now use building blocks on workspace level as parent dependencies
for tenant level building blocks. To do that, edit the building block definition
of your tenant level building block and add the workspace level building block as a dependency.
Please note that this does not work the other way around. Tenant level building 
blocks cannot be parent dependencies for workspace level building blocks.

### Fixed Broken Landing Zone Edit Link
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've introduced with our new actions dropdown a broken link to edit the 
landing zone in the service management area. This has been fixed.

### New meshObject API endpoints for meshUsers
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API in meshStack now provides new endpoints for POST, PUT and DELETE operations on meshUsers. 
These endpoints require an API Key with the appropriate admin permission. 
We recommend using these endpoints only for advanced IAM integration scenarios where you cannot use meshStack's SCIM integration.

### Building Blocks on Workspace Control Plane
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We changed the content of the building blocks tab on the workspace control plane
so it shows only building blocks on workspace level and no longer any building blocks
that belong to tenants of the current workspace.

### Fix Placeholders in Building Block Failed E-Mail
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When an email was sent for a workspace building block, the tenant related fields were still shown in the email.
Those fields are now not shown anymore for workspace level building block.

### Fix Update of Unmanaged Tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When importing an unmanaged tenant into meshStack, the tenant remained in the unmanaged tenant list.
This issue only affected meshStacks that were set up since December 2024. The issue is fixed now.

### Expandable Tags
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now have a button to expand/collapse the tags. This is useful when you have a lot of tags and you want to see them all at once.

### Fixed Workspace Filtering
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the admin area projects list, the workspace filter was not working correctly. This has been fixed.

### Fix Error on Communication Definition Deletion
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Release v2025.10.0 introduced a regression that led to an error when a communication definition was deleted.
This has been fixed.

### Building Block Runs fail on Missing Outputs
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously a building block run that did not return all the expected outputs would be successful
but children depending on the now missing outputs never ran and seemed stuck.
Now if a run ends but not all outputs are provided it is marked as failed so building block developer
can quickly identify this problem and fix it.

### Removal of old Azure Role management API
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have updated the Azure API for role management to the latest version, now also in use for 
Azure Kubernetes platforms and Azure Blueprint assignment functionality. No behavior changes are expected.

### Inputs in Platform Configurations are Trimmed
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Form inputs in the admin area's platform configuration are now automatically 
trimmed for whitespace, reducing copy-and-paste errors.

### Unsaved Changes Alert in Building Blocks Definition
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To enhance building blocks definition creation and editing, and reduce unintended data loss, users will now receive a confirmation 
alert when navigating away from the building blocks definition creation or edit page with unsaved changes.

### Minor Changes to API Key Login
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This release introduces minor changes to the way meshStack records API Key logins.
When calling "/api/login" clients will now receive a HTTP 307 redirect code to meshStack's identity broker
instead of the HTTP 308 code used previously. This prevents client-side caching of the redirect URL.
meshStack now updates the "last login" timestamp for an API key upon login attempt instead of only updating the timestamp
on successful API requests. This change ensures that the "last login" timestamp accurately reflects attempts to use the API key.

### Rename Platform Type Marketplace to OSB Services
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
This ensures a consistent naming across the application.

### Abort Building Block Run Improvement
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The functionality to abort a ongoing building block run
has been improved in a way that all asynchronous runs are 
now aborted immediately within meshStack.

### Fix Error on Project Role Change
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Release v2025.10.0 introduced a regression that led to an error when a
project role was changed for a user or a group. This has been fixed.

### Improved Tag Representation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have improved the representation of the tags in the panel so 
that the screens no longer appear broken due to the length and 
quantity. The tags are now displayed in a table format, 
which allows for a more organized and structured view of the tags.

### Removed Tenants Column
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have removed the tenants column from the projects overview in admin area 
to simplify the view and make it easier to read.

### Building Block Definition Deletion Improvement
**Audience:** Partner, Operator, User<br>

#### Description
Previous to this change it was not possible to delete a building block definition
in case another building block definition would depend on it. Now, you can delete 
a building block definition even if there is another building block definition 
depending on it, as long as the latest version of the child definition no longer
depends on the definition that was previously the parent.

### Include Empty Tenant Usage Reports in Chargeback Statements
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, Tenant Usage Reports were sometimes not included in a
Chargeback Statement if that Tenant Usage Report had no line items (and
therefore also no costs). This has been fixed, such that a Chargeback
Statement now always includes all related Tenant Usage Reports, even if they
have no line items.
While this change does not change anything related to the actual costs of a
Chargeback Statement, it provides more transparency, since you now see at a
glance all tenants that are part of a Chargeback Statement, even if they did
not incur any costs.
Please note that this change takes effect only for non-finalized and newly created
chargeback statements. Chargeback statements that are already finalized are
not impacted.

### Fix Creation of Incorrect Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Under some circumstances, incorrect event logs were created.
For example, if a user had access to a workspace both via a group binding and a user
binding, and the group binding had an expiration date, and the role of the
group binding was changed, then incorrect events of type "Workspace Group Role
Expiration Date Changed" and "Workspace User Role Expiration Date Changed" have
been created. A similar issue existed for project bindings.
These issues have been fixed.

### Fix Creation of Unnecessary Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when the expiration date or the role of a workspace group binding
was changed, this change was logged not only for the group itself, but also for
each individual group member. For example, if the associated group had 5
members, then 6 event logs were created, with one event log for the group
itself, and 5 event logs for the members. This has been changed such that
only the group-level event log is created.
With this change, we reduce the number of newly created event logs, which is
beneficial for performance reasons, as the search function can become slow when
the number of events grow large. At the same time, we provide the same level of
transparency as before, since we already audit which member was added to or
removed from a group.

### meshObject API Endpoint Reject Unsupported Media Types
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Some meshObject API endpoints incorrectly accepted unsupported media types.
This behavior has been fixed in this release and clients will now receive a HTTP 406 Not Acceptable error response.

#### How to use
This bug could lead to clients receiving a response with a content-type not matching the content-types specified
in the request's accept header. We have notified admin teams of affected meshStack instances. If you did not receive
an email from us about this issue, your use of the meshObject API was not affected by this bug.

We have identified the following situations where this bug did occur:

- accept headers specifying a non-existent meshObject versions like "application/vnd.meshcloud.api.meshuser.v3.hal+json" 
- accept headers specifying an unversioned media type like "application/json".

Only endpoints using the following meshObjects were affected by this bug:

- meshPaymentMethods
- meshProject
- meshServiceInstance
- meshTenant
- meshUser

Please review your use of meshObject API to ensure that you are setting the correct accept headers to receive
the expected version of a meshObject. See the API docs for more details.

### Replaced action buttons in tables with dropdowns
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We replaced the row of action buttons within the Workspaces, Projects, Landing Zones and Payment Methods in the admin area with a dropdown.
This is now more user-friendly and allows for more actions to be added in the future.

### Fix Sorting of Usage Reports by Total Amount
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When sorting Tenant Usage Reports by their total amount, the sorting was not
applied correctly in some cases. This has been fixed.

### Event Logs Show Events from Past Month by Default
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
The Event Log that is available in the Compliance section now has a
date filter pre-selected. By default, only events from the past month are
shown. This change alleviates performance issues with the search
functionality that can occur if the number of events grow large.

### Remove option to turn off Chargeback 2.0
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
As announced, the setting in the admin area to turn off Chargeback 2.0 is now removed. It is no longer
possible to switch back to the old chargeback mode. All envirnonments that were not switched to
Chargeback 2.0 yet are switched automatically now.

### Workspace Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
We are excited to announce that building blocks are now allowed on a workspace level! Previously, building blocks were only 
available on a per-tenant level. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and control over your workspace configurations.

#### How to use
A workspace building block definition can be created in both the service management area and the admin area.
To start using workspace building blocks, simply go to the marketplace and select a workspace type building block. The look 
and feel is consistent with tenant building blocks, making the transition seamless. These new building blocks are 
conveniently listed under a dedicated tab in the workspace control plane, ensuring easy access and management.

### meshObject API Deprecation Documentation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API documentation now includes a new section listing deprecated API endpoints
and deprecated meshObject versions. For every deprecation, the section includes the announced EoL date
and upgrade instructions. Please review this documentation to ensure your API clients stay up to date with meshObject API.

### meshObject API deprecation of meshCustomer
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This version of meshStack removes the meshCustomer object and its endpoints from the
meshObject API. This object has been deprecated for a very long time since its rename
to meshWorkspace.

### Audit Workspace User Group Membership Changes
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when a user was added to or removed from a Workspace User Group,
only the role changes resulting from this action were audited. For example,
when a user was added to a group that granted "Workspace Member" role to a
given workspace, only this role change was audited for that given user, but
it was not audited that the user was added to that group. Now, the addition
and removal of users from a workspace user group is also audited, allowing
you to track which user was added to or removed from which group.

### Http backend for Terraform state
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
meshStack now supports a basic http backend for Terraform state
that can be used for Terraform/OpenTofu building blocks.
To enable it simply activate the respective toggle button within the
implementation configuration of a building block definition.
The http backend will then automatically be used in case no other backend
is defined within the building block sources. API keys with matching permissions
can read and/or manipulate the state via the API.
For more details please refer to the building blocks section of the Administrator guide
within our documentation.

### Simpler logout procedure
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When a user logs out, they are redirected directly to the 
logged out screen instead of first seeing the additional 
logout screen from the identity provider.

### SCIM API support for application/scim+json
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The SCIM API supported by meshStack now correctly supports HTTP content negotiation
as defined by RFC 7644 using the "application/scim+json" media type.

#### How to use
meshStack's SCIM API responses will now always have a Content-Type header
of value "application/scim+json". Previously meshStack did return another media type
that was not defined in the RFC. API clients can now also explicitly request
"application/scim+json" via the Accept header, though this remains optional.

### Test Connection & Auto Import for Terraform Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating a Terraform building block in the UI, you can now test the connection to the target
git repository and automatically import all Terraform inputs & outputs. Please note that for
the time being this is only supported for public git providers GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps & Bitbucket.
Self-hosted variants are not supported at the moment.

#### How to use
When entering a valid repository URL in the Terraform building block creation form, a new button will
appear called "Test Connection". You can click this button to test the connection to the repository.
When landing on the "Inputs" part of the creation form, you will then be prompted to decide which
inputs & outputs to import.

### Fix sorting of Usage Reports and Chargeback Statements
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
When further pages of usage reports or chargeback statements were loaded, the sorting was not applied correctly
on the further pages. This fix ensures that the sorting is maintained when further pages are loaded.

### Admin permissions for API Keys to manage Service Instances
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This release adds new admin permissions for API keys to manage Service Instances across all workspaces.
Regular permissions for managing Service Instances within the API key's workspace remain available.

### Fixed HTTP response status codes for meshServiceInstance API
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have made a minor fix to HTTP response status codes returned by the meshObject API
endpoints for meshServiceInstance when submitting a duplicate service instanceId.
Please review the details of this release note for the specific changes.

#### How to use
The API operation POST /api/meshobjects/meshServiceInstances now returns a 409 status
code when a meshServiceInstance with the same instanceId already exists. 
Previously, the operation returned a HTTP 500 status code for this case.

Please note that this change is introduced without an explicit change in the API version for this endpoint
because we consider this to be a bug fix.

### Re-enable Access to old Projects with Invalid Deletion State
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If a tenant deletion was rejected by a platform operator in August or September 2024, the project did
not become active again after the rejection. The affected projects are now active again and can be 
accessed by the application teams. Only a very little amount of projects were affected by this issue.

### Don't show deleted OSB Plans in Marketplace
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Deleted OSB service plans were included in the internal pricing section of a service in the Marketplace. The
deleted plans are now not shown anymore for the internal pricing section as intended.

### Fix Forecast for Unused Payment Methods
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, the forecast in the payment method graph (i.e., the dotted line)
sometimes indicated a cost increase for payment methods that have already
been replaced by a different payment method. This has been fixed now, so that
the dotted line remains flat to correctly indicate that no further costs are
expected for this payment method.

### Moved Building Block Supported Platforms
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To streamline the Building Block configuration process, we have moved the Supported Platforms selection from the Implementation step to the 
General step, directly grouped with the Building Block Type selection if a Tenant Building Block is selected.

### Test connection and import for Terraform Building Blocks
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now test your connection to your SSH & HTTPS git repository for Terraform Building Blocks
and optionally import your inputs and outputs directly from the detected Terraform files.
Please note that this is currently only supported for cloud-hosted instances of GitHub, GitLab,
BitBucket and Azure DevOps. Self-hosted git providers are not supported at this time.

### Fix SSH Key not visible when URL contains special characters
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
For Terraform Building Block Definitions the SSH Key field would not be visible if
your repository URL contained special characters such as URL-encoded characters.
This is fixed now and the SSH Key field is visible as expected.

### Fix Workspace Creation for rare User Configuration
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In rare cases, new users were unable to create workspaces in meshStack. This only affected users that
had a special combination of user attributes. This issue has been fixed.

### Filter Building Blocks via Definition UUID in API
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
An additional query parameter was added to the building block API. You can now filter by building block definition UUID.

### Fix adding Validation Message on new Building Block Input
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When adding a new building block definition input, the "Message on Regular Expression Failure" was not getting saved.
Only when you set it again afterwards, it was saved as intended. This is fixed now.

### Fix known host not showing when provider name in URL
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
In the last release we introduced the functionality to hide the known host form for Terraform Building Blocks.
The hiding also wrongfully occurred for repository URLs where the provider name was mentioned e.g. gitlab.company.com.
This is now fixed and the known host form is available again in those cases.

### Fix Incorrect Data when Exporting Payment Methods via CSV
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, the Payment CSV export in the Admin Area under the Payment
Methods page still used data from the old Chargeback process, even if
Chargeback 2.0 was enabled. This has now been fixed, and it correctly exports
the updated data.

### Cleanup Expired Role Bindings
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Before, when a user was deleted in meshStack, their workspace role bindings were removed, but expired ones were 
accidentally skipped. Now, this has been fixed, and expired role bindings are deleted as well.

### Increased OSB platform restriction transparency
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If an OSB platform was restricted to certain workspaces, the 
service instances screen was inaccessible without showing an error 
if your workspace was once part of the restriction but has been removed. 
We now have improved transparency and added information on what to do if 
the current workspace no longer has access to the OSB platform.

### Remove Greeting from Email for Custom Recipients
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When providing a custom email address as a recipient for e.g. building block notifications,
the greeting in the email was broken, as it only showed placeholders. This is fixed now and in those
cases, no greeting is shown, as no name of the user is available to meshStack.

### Building Block Input and Output UI Improvement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we implemented a more streamlined and organized layout for Building Block input and output configurations. To this enhancement, 
a gap has been introduced between individual input and output sections, the deletion button has been moved from the header to the body of the input and output 
configuration for better visual flow and ease of access.

### Fix Sign Url for GitHub Platforms
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
If a building block in a GitHub platform provided a sign URL, the URL was not being used. This is fixed now.

### Fix Building Block Definition Notification Subscribers
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When notification subscribers were added to a building block definition, the subscribers were not shown
anymore after a page reload or when entering the building block definition again. Additionally, the creator 
of a building block definition is automatically added as a notification subscriber. This user was not displayed
either. This led to unexpected behavior when trying to add these users or remove newly added users again. 
Even though these users were not shown, they were still set and received notifications as intended.
The issue is fixed now and the existing subscription users are shown.

### Fix Tenant Movement to Project with same Identifier
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, it was not possible to move a tenant to another project within
another workspace if the new project had the same identifier as the old
project. This is now fixed.

### Explicit permission for importing unmanaged tenants via API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
There is now an explicit permission for importing any unmanaged tenants from any platform with API keys. 
This is a dedicated permission that can be given to workspace-scoped API keys without needing to give
out the almighty "Create and Update Tenants across all workspaces" permission.
The new permission can be found under "Admin: When creating Tenants in this workspace, allow importing unmanaged tenants from any platform".

### Fixed Incorrect Notifications about Exceeded Budgets
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, meshStack sent notifications to inform about exceeded budgets
even if the payment method was not associated to any project anymore. This
has been fixed.

### Improved Tag Validation
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
We improved the way tags on meshObjects get validated. This especially now includes, that updates made via API keys
have to comply fully with how the tag was defined in the tag editor in meshStack. This includes a check for whether the
tag is mandatory or restricted. It also checks for defined regex patterns and all other limitations defined on a tag
definition.

### Clickable links for Building Block Inputs & Outputs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If your building block input or output is formatted as a URL you can now directly
click on the value and open the respective URL is a new tab.

### Hide SSH and Known Host if not needed for Building Blocks
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When creating a Terraform Building Block, the SSH and Known Host fields are now hidden if they are not needed.
This change makes it easier to create Building Blocks that do not require SSH or Known Hosts.

### Spending Forecast for Payment Methods
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
We've added forecasting to the payment method graph. Now, when you view a
payment method chart in the panel, you'll see a dotted line projecting costs
for the next 12 months, helping you plan your spending ahead.

### Building Block Pricing Definition moved to General
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we have streamlined the building block definition process by repositioning the pricing form within the creation wizard. 
Previously a separate step, pricing is now integrated into the General step. Additionally, pricing is marked as optional, ensuring 
users they do not have to fill in this field if they do not want to.

### Fix Location dropdown shrinking when searching
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When creating a new platform, you can pick an existing location from a dropdown. When you started searching
in that dropdown, the width of the dropdown shrunk, so locations became pretty unreadable. This is now fixed.

### Fix Access to Usage Reports in Service Management Area
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
In some cases, users were unable to access usage reports in the service management area.
This issue has been resolved.

### Fix error when adding new Building Block Definition Input
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Recently a regression was introduced, that led to showing an error message, when adding a new input
to an existing Building Block Definition. This is fixed now and no error message is shown anymore.

### Fix Access Information for Azure Kubernetes Service
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When accessing an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) tenant via the UI, the access information was not shown. 
Instead, an error message was displayed. This is fixed now.

### Fix Boolean Inputs in Building Block Upgrade
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When upgrading a building block, boolean values that were set on the building block were not shown in the upgrade dialog.
Additionally boolean values were not set correctly during the upgrade and therefore not shown correctly
when going to the settings of the building block afterward. This is fixed now.

### Fix Building Block Input Edit as Operator
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
With the last release a regression was introduced, that did not show the set Building Block values anymore when
editing a Building Block as a Operator. This is fixed now.

### Turning on and off Currency Conversion in Self-Service
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now enable or disable currency conversion in self-service. The
configuration can be found in the admin area under Settings, within the
Financials tab. Additionally, the user experience of this settings page has
been improved.

### Fix broken building blocks links
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Some links in the admin area & service management area leading to building blocks broke in the last release.
These have now been fixed and you should no longer run into any broken links.

### Fix "Open Repository" when no git reference is set
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Platform engineers can quickly open the terraform source code implementing a building block
from the Building Block Definition using the "Open Repository" button. This release fixes
an issue where that button ignored the "Git repository path" when the building block definition did not 
explicitly set a git reference (like HEAD or main). Now, the "Open Repository" button will correctly
open the repository in supported git providers (GitHub, GitLab, bitbucket) at the specified path.

### Improve Visibility of Payment Method Amount
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When you created a new payment method, the payment method table only showed that 0 EUR are used. You did not see
the configured amount. The amount is now always shown, if set.

### Search in tables has been made more robust
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Search fields in tables now support special characters.

### Improvement of Workspace/Project Search in tables
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now search and select a dedicated workspace/project using a dropdown menu.

### Non Admin Users Can Not Modify Locations Anymore

As locations are potentially shared between different platform instances the edit right for regular users 
was removed. Locations can now only be edited by admins from the admin area.

### Enhancements to Building Block Definition Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we enhanced the General tab of the Building Block Definition creation interface. And we added a new input field that 
allows you to select the type of building block. This marks an important step toward supporting workspace building blocks in the future.
At this stage, you can select only tenant building blocks.

### Revised access control search
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In recent weeks, we have added the ability to search for users/groups 
within the access control screens. This change may cause unexpected 
validation errors. The view has been revised and made more robust.

### Fix Boolean Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When editing building block inputs of type boolean, the default 
value was displayed instead of the actual value in some cases. This is now fixed.

### Remove unassigned users from notification recipients
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, there were occurrences where users removed from a workspace were still
receiving notifications. Now, users removed from a workspace are periodically cleaned up
from the notification recipients list. This ensures that only users with access to a workspace 
are notified.

### API key row alignment
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have resolved the alignment of the API key overview rows within the workspace control 
plane. The offset within rows has been resolved. The columns now match the row values again.

### Adding Access Request Rejected to Event Logs
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously when 4-eyes principle was enabled, in rare cases no events were written when an access request to a workspace was rejected. This issue has been resolved, and access request rejected events are now consistently logged.

### Merge Building Block Menus into One
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
For a long time there were two menu items in the Admin Area & Service Management Area for managing building blocks
and their definitions. We now merged these two menus and pages into one. This should make it easier to find what
you are looking for.

### Fix SCIM Group Deletion
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you attempted to delete a group via SCIM that is assigned to one or more workspaces, an error occurred, preventing the action from completing successfully. This issue has been fixed.

### API Key read-only Permissions for Workspaces
**Audience:** Partner, User<br>

#### Description
Users can now add a new permission to API Keys to read the workspace that owns the API key from meshObject API.
Admins can add a new admin permissions to API Keys that grants access to list all workspaces.

### Remove Project Deletion Queue
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have removed the project deletion queue which could be found in the workspace overview under projects -> Deletion Queue.
A while back we introduced visibility of projects that are awaiting deletion directly in the project overview.
This made the deletion queue redundant and we have now removed it.

### Prevent assignment of unknown tags
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Tags without a definition can no longer be added via the meshObject API. 
If you try to do so, you will get an error from the API.

### Chargeback Statements For Projects Without Payment Method
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, there was a bug in Chargeback 2.0 where chargeback statements were not generated for projects without 
a payment method in meshStacks where the payment method was configured as non-mandatory by our support team. 
This issue has now been resolved, and you will see the chargeback statements even if there is no payment 
method set.

### Turning on and off Chargeback 2.0 in Self-Service
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now turn off and on the Chargeback 2.0 process in self-service under
the Financial subsection of the Settings page. Please note that turning off
the Chargeback 2.0 option will be only available until the end of February
and starting from March 1, 2025, Chargeback 2.0 will be the default version.
Please find more information about Chargeback 2.0 changes and limitations
[here](https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshcloud.chargeback-v2.html).

### OSB Service Broker Usage with Chargeback 2.0
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The OSB Service Broker Metering & Usage screen and CSV export are now also based on Chargeback 2.0 data.
Except for a slightly improved default ordering for the lines in the table and the CSV export, no difference
in data is expected. You can continue to use it as before.

### Use Any Email For Building Block Notifications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug which prevented you from saving building block definitions if a user lost access
to your workspace and was set as a notification receiver.
It also enables you to use any email address (also those that are not users in meshStack) to 
receive building block updates such as a group inbox.
User and email notification receiver are now no longer tied to the workspace access in order
to receive notifications regarding building blocks.

### New Chart for Payment Methods
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this update, we have added a new chart to the payment method, which displays the total spending for each payment method with a dedicated 
budget line in addition to the distribution of spending across projects chart.

### Finalize Partly Incomplete Chargeback Statements
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, in the new chargeback 2.0 process, non-finalized chargeback
statements from past periods were automatically deleted. This could happen if
a single Tenant Usage Report that was part of this chargeback statement was
not finalized, for example, because the underlying platform was already
deleted and therefore no new costs were collected. This has been fixed now.
If a Tenant Usage Report cannot be finalized for whatever reason, the
associated chargeback statement will be finalized and it will have this
particular Tenant Usage Report removed from its line items. This fix also
creates missing chargeback statements that were deleted in the past, because
some usage reports were not finalized.

### Fixed Chargeback Line Item Numbering
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The tenant usage reports in chargeback statements previously displayed 
incorrect numbering. Additionally, these reports were duplicated when 
multiple line items existed for them with different sellers. Both 
issues have now been resolved.

### No notifications for deleted API Keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Notifications are no longer sent out for API keys 
that are about to expire in case the API key has been
already deleted.

### Projects without Payment Methods for Chargeback 2.0
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change and Chargeback 2.0 activated, if your project doesn't have a payment method because the previous 
one expired and you haven't set a new one yet, we'll still generate and finalize tenant usage reports without 
payment methods, but chargeback statements won't be generated.
When you set a new payment method, all past tenant usage reports that were missing one and include 
the new payment method get updated. Also chargeback statements for those periods get generated with the new 
payment method.

### Product Search in Tenant Usage Reports
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
As part of improving the user experience in the financial overview, a search bar has been introduced to the Product column in the Tenant Usage 
Report, allowing you to quickly search and filter resources by product, eliminating the need to navigate through extensive cost lists manually.

### Move disabled platforms down platform selection
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When selecting platforms, either for an existing or new project, all disabled platforms are moved to the bottom of the list.
This should make it easier for users in meshStacks with a lot of platform to filter out platforms that are not available
either due to mismatching policies or platform misconfiguration.

### Fixes Upgrade of Building Blocks with Dependency
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented upgrading an existing building 
block to a new version in which the parent dependency was removed.

### New MeshTenantUsageReport API Version
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With this release, we are introducing version 3 of meshTenantUsageReport API, providing additional 
fields and more detailed responses. meshTenantUsageReport API v3 also includes individual usage report 
line items grouped by seller and product group. Please be aware, that this new version is only supported 
if you are switched on to Chargeback 2.0. From March 1st 2025 on, meshTenantUsageReport API v2 will not be 
available at all anymore, see more information 
[here](https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshcloud.chargeback-v2.html).

### Fixes "Owner can not be removed" issue in Azure
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If a role was updated/swapped which was the last owner role assignment on an Azure Subscription
this could lead to the "Owner can not be removed" error during replication. This has been fixed.

### Fixed Project Filtering Issue in Admin Panel Workspace View
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When you click the "show projects" button in the admin panel workspace view the name instead of the workspace 
identifier was used for project filtering. This could lead to inconsistencies in the display of the project 
list and it has been fixed.

### Fix environmental usage reports with missing line items
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
For customers who already use the new chargeback 2.0 process, environmental
tenant usage reports have not been successfully created in some cases. The
tenant usage reports have included only a single zero-valued line item, even
if the cloud provider had already provided the CO2 costs. This is now fixed.
Only environmental usage reports (which are shown in the panel in the
'GreenOps' section) that were created in the recent few months were impacted
by this issue.

### Abort building block runs
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Operators have now the possibility to abort runs that are pending 
or in progress. This can be achieved by navigating to the run details
view within the admin area of the panel and click the 'Abort run' button.
It is also possible to send a run update with the 'ABORTED' status via the
meshObject API. The abort action will be accepted immediately but it can
take a moment to come into effect.

### Terraform Input Importer Works With Numbers
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug which prevented the detection of numeric defaults in the 
Terraform building block definition input importer.

### Building Block Definition Journey
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have introduced a guided visualization to help engineers understand 
the necessary steps for publishing a building block definition in the 
marketplace. This journey process is now available in the dedicated 
'Building Block Definition' general tab within the Service Management 
area. Engineers can follow this guidance from the initial setup until 
the definition is successfully published.

### Building Blocks Success Notifications temporarily disabled
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have temporarily removed the notification functionality related to succeeded building block creations. This decision was made to address feedback about the distracting nature of these notifications. We are working on a refined solution that will allow users to specify recipients of notifications, ensuring relevant updates are communicated in a non-intrusive manner. Thank you for your understanding as we improve this feature to better meet your needs. Stay tuned for updates on the improved functionality!

### Enhanced Role Recertification Experience for Access Control
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we improved visibility for expiring roles on the Access Control page. Expiring roles now have clear visual cues, Yellow highlight 
for roles expiring in less than 30 days, Red highlight for roles expiring in less than 7 days, and Black highlight for expired roles.

### Show Configured Support Links in Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The configured support and documentation links for regular users are now
shown in the admin area settings panel. This helps admins to verify those
links.

### Warns if Landing Zone Building Block Misses Local Id Output
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
If you create a landing zone for a custom platform it is required to have a building block 
which will provide a local id of the created tenant as an output. Now there is a warning if
no such building block was selected.

### Fix Terraform Building Blocks PATH
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when providing inputs as environment variables during execution, the PATH variable was not included in the environment setup. This omission could result in errors with certain Terraform functions that rely on external executables, such as Git. This is fixed now.

### Configure Message of the Day in Settings
**Audience:** Partner, User<br>

#### Description
Admins can now set a "Message of the Day" in self-service from the Admin Area -> Settings page.
When activated, this message will be displayed on the workspace control plane for all users. 
Admins can use markdown for rich formatting.

### Improved Review Screen for Tenant Movement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this update we improved the review screen for tenant movement to ensure a more comprehensive review process during tenant movement. The tenant 
movement review screen now includes additional information about tenant usage report, policy violations, and user access.

### Expiring API Key Reminder Notifications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
As workspace owners or managers, you will now automatically receive reminders about expiring API keys. This ensures you can renew or replace them in time, avoiding disruptions to your applications.

### Simplified Building Block Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the service management area, it is now possible to create building 
blocks directly in the building block definition view. Simply select 
an existing tenant and configure the building block.

### Fix for Failing Azure Subscription Owner Removals
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
In some environments the removal of the replicator principal from new Azure Subscriptions
failed because of a bug in existing role detection. This has been fixed.

### ABAC Support for Azure Role Assignments
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this update, we enable the support for ABAC role assignments.
This Azure functionality allows more fine-grained control of how your users
can access your Subscription and resources.
This feature currently needs to be enabled via a feature flag.
Please contact the support if you want to try it out.

#### How to use
After the feature is enabled in your environment you can use the landing
zone configuration page to set up the Azure ABAC conditions in the role mapping
options. The ABAC condition is actively checked during replication and if needed 
is re-applied by the replication process.

### Deactivate meshCustomer Endpoints
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
After we have renamed meshCustomer to meshWorkspace, our meshCustomer
endpoints have remained available to ensure a smooth migration process for
every customer.
We have previously announced that our legacy meshCustomer API endpoints will
eventually be removed, and we have gradually deactivated the legacy endpoints
in more and more customer environments. With this release, the meshCustomer
API endpoints are now deactivated in all customer environments.
Most customers are not impacted by this change, since we have already
deactivated the legacy meshCustomer endpoints in the past for these environments.

#### How to use
For every meshCustomer endpoint that has been deactivated, there is a
corresponding meshWorkspace endpoint. Please follow our API docs for more
details.

### Enforce Versioned Accept Header for API
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
After we have previously announced that our API endpoints will require a
versioned Accept header, we have gradually enforced this in more and more
customer environments. With this release, all customer environments are now
configured such that the versioned Accept header is required.
Most customers are not impacted by this change, since we have already
introduced this configuration change in the past for these environments.

#### How to use
Please be aware that the Accept header is also required when you call a POST or PUT endpoint.
This information is included in the API documentation. Following the API docs
will ensure your requests work correctly.

### Access Overview For Tenant Movement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this update, we've made moving tenants clearer with a new step showing access and permissions for the destination project, so you know exactly 
who will have access for tenants after you move it.

### Display Email Instead of Username in Workspace Access Area
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This update resolves a cosmetic issue by ensuring that user email 
addresses are consistently displayed in the user lists within both 
the project and workspace access screens.

### Search for Users in Workspace Access
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Finding and managing users' workspace access is now easier with a new search bar in the Workspace Access section.
This search control is also available when managing workspace access from the Admin Area. 
This update simplifies member searches and streamlines workspace management.

### Fix Access to Payment Methods with Chargeback Legacy Mode
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, for Chargeback 1.0 version admins were unable to access the Payment Methods view in the panel, preventing any modification or editing of payment methods. This has been fixed.

### Duplicate or missing Chargeback Statements in Lists
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
In the new Chargeback 2.0 process, when viewing chargeback statements via the
panel or exporting chargeback statements via the CSV export, it could happen
that chargeback statements were shown more often than once or not at all.
This has been fixed.
The meshObject API is not impacted by this issue. Every customer who is still
using the old chargeback process is also not impacted.

### Quotas for Workspace API Keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now enforce the maximum number of API Keys per workspace using the workspace quota system.
A default quota of 10 is currently set for all workspaces. This default can be changed in the Admin Area
under Settings -> Compliance -> Default Workspace API Key Limit.

### Building Block Definition Button
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have added a new button to the building block view to make it easy to open 
the corresponding building block definition. This allows easy navigation between
building block and building block definition during the development.

### Improved Loading Experience for Project Selection
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have made it easier for you to know when data is loading during the first step of the move tenant flow. Instead of showing "No Items" while 
your project list is being prepared, you'll now see a "Loading" message. This ensures you know the system is working and avoids any confusion.

### Cost History for Tenant Movement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To improve transparency and usability in the tenant movement process, a new step Cost History has been introduced to the move tenant flow. This 
step gives you a clear view of how moving a tenant between projects and workspaces will affect tenant usage reports, helping you make informed 
financial decisions.

### Added Building Blocks Tab
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have added a building blocks tab within the building block definition control plane to get a 
direct overview of the building blocks that have been created depending on the definition.
The change relates to the service management area and admin area.

### Fixes Azure Replication With Certain Role Config
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a regression that could cause Azure replications to fail if you had the same Azure role
mapped to multiple roles in meshStack.

### Fix Failing Tag Definition Update with Default Value
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In certain cases, when you update the definition of a single-select tag with a default value, you may encounter an error. This issue has now been fixed.

### Set API Key Expiration Date Limit
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
As an admin, you can now define a maximum expiration period, and users will be required to set their API key expirations within that timeframe. This helps you maintain control over key lifetimes.

### CSV Export for Chargeback 2.0
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
The CSV export of chargeback statements is now available for the Chargeback 2.0 process. 
It retains the same structure as the CSV export from the previous chargeback process. 
This export includes only the updated cost data, ensuring the report reflects the latest information, 
such as late bills from providers.

### Drag and drop only works via drag element
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously you could drag and drop the entire row when moving items around (in the Building Block Inputs & Tag Overview).
This caused issues when trying to copy text out of this element.
To fix this, you can now only drag and drop elements via the small "dotted icon" dragging element at the
start of a row. This will allow you to copy text again without problems.

### Enhanced Workspace Project and Payment Overview
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now have a better overview of projects and payment methods for a specific workspace from the Admin Area. With this change, the project and payment method views on the workspace page are updated to more user-friendly overviews with filters and sorting capabilities, making it easier for you to quickly find and manage relevant information for each workspace.

### Fix Import of Multiple Tenants With Equal Local Ids
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the successful import of tenants via the meshObject API
if the local id was equal but the tenants were located in different platform instances.

### Fix GCP Tenant Usage Reports and Chargebacks for November
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, an issue in Chargeback 2.0 from mid-november prevented GCP tenant usage reports from opening 
when environmental reports also existed. Additionally it resulted in wrong line items in preview chargeback 
statements. This issue has now been fixed, ensuring the reports are correct. Since the problem only affected 
november reports, which have not been finalized, no action is needed from you.

### Slow performance when moving tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This improves the performance of the tenant move wizard.
The tenant move wizard loaded a lot of data in the background. In environments with a lot of
projects and tenants this could lead to very slow behavior. This is now fixed.

### Missing Partner Employee Permissions
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Due to a permissions issue, the Partner Employee role was no longer able to see and manage payment 
methods in the Partner area. The permissions have been adjusted and the issue has been resolved.

### Manage Workspace Users from the Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Now you are be able to manage users directly from the admin area. This includes assigning, deleting, and changing roles, 
as well as setting expiration dates, all without needing to assign yourself to this specific workspace. Note that this 
functionality is available only to users with Partner Admin or Partner Employee roles.

### Deprecation of meshStack resource inventory
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack previously supported the inventory of Virtual Machines on OpenStack, accessible in the Admin Area
under Resources > Platforms. This feature has now been fully deprecated and removed from meshStack.

### Workspace Role Recertification Reminders
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To help you manage role recertification more easily, we have introduced a pop-up window that appears after logging in, 
if your own or team member roles of any workspace you manage, expire. A banner is also shown on the workspace control plane 
that reminds users about expiring workspace accesses. This helps you manage roles proactively and prevent any loss 
of access.

### Extend meshObject API with meshWorkspaceGroupBindings
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API was extended to support the creation, deletion and
retrieval of meshWorkspaceGroupBindings via the imperative meshObject API
endpoints (as opposed to the declarative meshObject API endpoints).

#### How to use
The documentation for the new API endpoints is available in our meshObject
API documentation, below the meshProjectGroupBinding. For now, this
functionality is only available for API users, and not for API keys. Support
for API keys will be available in the future.

### meshObject API meshWorkspaceUserBinding status codes changes
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change, we have updated the HTTP response status codes for the
newly introduced meshObject API meshWorkspaceUserBindings endpoints to align
them with the behavior of other API endpoints. The POST
/api/meshobjects/meshworkspacebindings/userbindings endpoint now returns a
201 status code when creating a new meshWorkspaceUserBinding. If you're
already using this API endpoint, please update your status code check to 201.

### Fix Tags Editing for Payment Method
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We identified and resolved an issue where the payment method tags could not 
be updated in the workspace area under the financial section. This issue has 
now been fixed, and all payment method tags can be updated as expected.

### Improved logging when GCP Cloud Function call fails
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This adds the used parameter to the admin logs when a GCP cloud function call fails during
a GCP tenant replication.

### Remove erroneously updated Chargebacks and Usage Reports
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
For customers that already use our newly revamped chargeback process, the
previous release accidentally caused existing chargeback statements to be
cancelled and replaced by new chargeback statements, even though there were
no differences between the cancelled chargeback statement and the new
chargeback statement. Only chargeback statements that included Azure cost
items from the period of October 2024 were impacted.
This has been fixed, such that the erroneously created chargeback statements
are removed, and the corresponding chargeback statements that were previously
shown as cancelled are reset to their original state.
This essentially means that chargeback statements that were previously shown
with a yellow "Updated" badge are now shown with the green "Finalized" badge
again. The actual line items (charges) inside the chargeback statement are
not in any way modified by this fix.
The same applies to Tenant Usage Reports.

### Empty Recommended Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Before this change it could happen that the recommended building blocks page during the tenant/project 
creation was empty in case no building blocks existed or all possible building blocks were already added. 
This has now been adjusted so that the step has been removed if no recommended building blocks are available.

### Missing projects when adding tenants via marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Resolves an issue where projects were incorrectly displayed as ineligible for adding a tenant when initially selecting the tenant from the marketplace.
Specifically, projects with previously deleted tenants of the same platform were incorrectly shown as unavailable for receiving a new tenant.

### Improved error message for last Subscription owner removal
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Azure does not allow the last Owner of a Subscription to be removed. This is often an issue with
Azure platform configurations. Since the replicator principal can not be used as the owner
(doing so in the configuration had no effect), the error message was now improved to point this out.

### Fix Deletion Mode Update in Pipeline Automation Definition
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When updating the deletion mode from 'Purge' to 'Delete Resources' in a Building Block Definition of type 'Pipeline Automation,' an error persists, preventing the update even when a destroy file is present.

### Fix Building Block Definition Update to Pipeline Automation
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We have resolved an issue where an error message, "Implementation Details missing," appeared when changing the implementation type of a Building Block Definition to "Pipeline Automation." This error no longer occurs, ensuring a smoother and more reliable experience when updating your Building Block Definitions.

### Removed Workspace Alias in Create Workspace Wizard
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
meshStack Enterprise included an option to set an alias for "Workspace" 
in the Create Workspace Wizard. This feature was removed in this release and
the wizard now consistently refers to the workspace as "Workspace".

#### How to use
The original intent of the alias was to provide better guidance to application 
teams when setting up a workspace in accordance with the rules of their organization.
However we found this feature was not widely used and the inconsistent terminology
introduced by the alias is causing confusion with application teams.

### Fix Landing Zone Creation of Custom Platforms
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, after you created a new custom platform, the platform was not automatically pre-selected on the landing zone creation screen, preventing you from creating a landing zone immediately. The workaround was to refresh the page to make the platform selectable. This has been fixed.

### meshObject API meshBuildingBlock status codes changed
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have made minor changes to HTTP response status codes returned by the meshObject API
endpoints for meshBuildingBlock to improve consistency with the behavior of other endpoints in the API.
Please review the details of this release note for the specific changes.

#### How to use
The API operation POST /api/meshobjects/meshbuildingblocks now returns a 201 status code
when creating a new meshBuildingBlock. Since meshStack v2024.29 this operation started
returning a 200 status code. This release reverts this unannounced change.

The API operation GET /api/meshobjects/meshbuildingblocks/{id} now returns a 403 status codes
when the API key making the request does not have access to this building block. Previously, the operation
returned a 404 status code.

Please note that this change is introduced without an explicit change in the API version for this endpoint.
API clients that strictly check the exact status code (e.g., 201 vs. 200) for these operations might observe 
this as a breaking change. In general we advise that API clients be as lenient when parsing API responses,
for example, by checking for success (2xx status code) instead. 

We do consider making status codes part of our versioning policy going forward to avoid potential breaking changes
for clients.

### API Key Admin Permissions for Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Admins can now add new admin permissions to API Keys that grant access
to list, save or delete Building Blocks in any workspace.

### Fix Azure Geo-Replication Cost
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, meshStack did not process Geo-Replication bandwidth costs for
Azure correctly, which could result in the reported costs being lower than
actual. Our initial findings indicate that the cost items that have not been
processed correctly include only very small amounts.
We will reach out to every customer impacted by this to elaborate on
this issue.
Please note that this fix requires a migration which will temporarily remove
all Azure cost items from non-finalized Tenant Usage Reports of the current
month. This is a transient issue that will resolve itself within less than 24
hours.

### Clean up non-finalized Preview Chargebacks
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change, we introduce a mechanism that regularly removes Preview Chargeback Statements from past periods in case
they have not been finalized. For example, not finalizing a Preview Chargeback Statement can happen if the underlying
usage reports cannot be finalized due to some collection issues. In those cases the Preview Chargeback Statements
should be deleted, as the usage reports will be part of an upcoming Chargeback Statement once the usage report is finalized.

### Workspace Access Count Not Properly Updated
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the workspace access user count 
display from updating properly when a new workspace was created.

### Allow login even if tenant replication fails
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This improves the login behavior when a tenant replication signals a failure. As long as the user's login information
on the project is present (e.g. from a previous successful replication) a login is now signaled as possible.
This should more often allow the users to access a cloud tenant even if there is a replication failure
at the moment.

### Reorder Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
As an owner of a building block definition you can now change the order of the
inputs by dragging and dropping them in the Inputs section of the
building block definition page. By doing so, you will influence the order in
which the inputs are shown to end users when adding a new building block.

### Beta Move Tenants Between Projects
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
As an admin you can try a beta feature to move tenants between projects. You can move the tenants within 
the same or even to another workspace. Please read the limitations and movement info in meshStack carefully!
You can also reach out to support@meshcloud.io for getting support when you want to move a tenant with support.

#### How to use
A tenant can be moved in the Admin Area when you open a tenant and go to Settings -> Move Tenant. This feature 
is only available for environments using the new chargeback process. Moving a tenant may disrupt IaC or API 
setups, as the old tenant identifier contains the assigned workspace and project.
These identifiers will need manual adjustment until API and Terraform provider updates are released to use 
the new, workspace/project-independent identifiers.

### Restricted Landing Zone Permissions for Admin API
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When creating an API user, admins could assign the permission "Allow using restricted meshLandingZone in meshTenant Import".
This release removes this dedicated permission to simplify the permission model, as this is considered an admin operation anyway.
All API users with the permission "Allow to import unmanaged existing tenants into meshStack" or "Import any supported meshObject" can now use restricted landing zones.
API keys with the permission "Admin: Create and Update Tenant in any workspace" can also use restricted landing zones.

### Improved Selection of API Key Permissions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating or editing API Key permissions, meshPanel now groups and
consistently sorts the available API Key permissions. This simplifies
browsing the growing amount of available permissions and selecting the
right ones for your API key.

### GitHub tenants
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Tenants of GitHub platform type are now correctly listed 
in the admin section of the panel as well as on the tenant control plane.
It is now also possible to provide a platform tenant id as output
for building blocks on GitHub platforms.

### API Key Admin Permissions for Tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Admins can now add new admin permissions to API Keys that grant access
to list, save or delete Tenants for any workspace.

### meshObject API meshTenant status codes changes
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have made minor changes to HTTP response status codes returned by the meshObject API
endpoints for meshTenant to improve consistency with the behavior of other endpoints in the API.
Please review the details of this release note for the specific changes.

#### How to use
The API operation POST /api/meshobjects/meshtenants now returns a 201 status code
when creating a new meshTenant. Since meshStack v2024.29 this operation started
returning a 200 status code. This release reverts this unannounced change.

Please note that this change is introduced without an explicit change in the API version for this endpoint.
API clients that strictly check the exact status code (e.g., 201 vs. 200) for these operations might observe 
this as a breaking change. In general we advise that API clients be as lenient when parsing API responses,
for example, by checking for success (2xx status code) instead. 

We do consider making status codes part of our versioning policy going forward to avoid potential breaking changes
for clients.

### Extra details in API response on HTTP 401 error
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This improves the HTTP 401 error message and now returns a proper error text.
This fix also add a JSON content-type header for other API error 
responses.

### Landing Zone creation for GitHub
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We removed a bug where landing zone creation was not possible
for all platforms of type 'GitHub'.

### Pipeline Trigger for GitHub Action Workflows
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
This functionality empowers platform engineers to provide seamless, easy-to-consume infrastructure automation for application teams. Platform engineers can now offer "Pipeline Building Blocks" that trigger GitHub Action Workflows when added to a tenant. These building block definitions can be published to the marketplace, enabling a smooth user experience for application teams to access and use existing automation without needing Git expertise. We will provide a guide shortly via the product documentation.

### Filter on Status for Chargebacks and Usage Reports
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now filter chargeback statements and tenant usage reports by status (Open, Finalized, Updated) 
using a dropdown filter and you can sort the list by the "Generated at" column to easily check for late bills.
Please note that this improvement is available only if you???re on the new version of the chargeback process.

#### How to use
To check for all late bills from a previous period, set the "Generated at" column to descending 
order to view the most recent changes at the top. Then, select "Updated" from the status dropdown and 
choose the desired period from period column. This will allow you to easily identify any late bills for 
the specified period.

### Fix Chargeback Statements with Deleted Tenants
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
In rare cases, chargeback statements were incomplete when some of their
tenants were already deleted. This is fixed now. Please note that all
chargeback statements will be re-generated after the deployment to fix the
incorrect chargeback statements. This process may take a few minutes and
during this process, chargeback statements will be incomplete.

### Event Logs for User Deletions
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When a user is deleted from meshStack, this event is now logged in the Event
Logs section of the Admin Area. To view these events, simply filter by
selecting Type as "Deleted" and Event as "User".

### Exclude Costs from Unmanaged Tenants in Dashboards
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With the recently introduced revamped chargeback process, the financials
dashboard included costs both from tenants managed via meshStack and
unmanaged tenants. This was changed back to the old behavior where the
dashboards have shown only costs from managed tenants.

### Create, Update and Delete meshTagDefinition via API
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Admins can now create, update and delete meshTagDefinitions via the meshObject API.
Using the terraform provider for meshStack, this enables admins to manage more of their 
meshStack's configuration as code.

### Better response for meshObject user and group binding API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The docs state that updates to the project user and group bindings are not possible, but the API
only responded with an HTTP 500 error, regardless of what the exact underlying issue was.
This has been improved and the error is now a proper HTTP 409 with a proper error message.

### Fix Receiving Update After Replication
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Release v2024.47.0 included a regression, that led to replication results not being updated.
As the release v2024.47.0 was not rolled out anywhere, you were not affected by this issue.
With this new release, the issue is resolved.

### Workspace Creation Wizard Improvement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The workspace creation wizard now includes an immediate check for duplicate billing information. 
If a duplicate is detected, you???ll receive a warning right at the relevant step, rather than at 
the end of the process.

### Improved transparency in the chargeback process
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The chargeback process in meshStack has been revamped. Late cost data will now be included into the existing 
chargeback statements rather than being deferred to the next chargeback period. On top of that, it is now more 
transparent in the panel when this happens and you can easily open up chargeback statements and see the 
historical changes that happened to them. Please note that if we have not notified you about this new chargeback process, 
it is not activated yet in your meshStack. We will get in touch in the future to align on a rollout of the new and 
improved chargeback process.

### Improved Admin Setup for Initial Workspace and Project Tags
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The admin area will now always show the "Edit Tags" actions on the "Workspaces" and "Projects" list views,
even when no tags are defined yet. From this screen, the panel will now guide you to setting up your first tags.
The "Edit Tags" actions are, of course, only available to users with the "Partner Admin" role.

### Workspace Access Helper Not Excluding Non-Active Projects
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When a user was added to a workspace, the access helper dialog also 
listed projects already in a deletion process. This has been fixed.

### Data migration for moving tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Replication might not work directly after the rollout of the new release.
This is due to a data migration effort. As we work on the support of
moving tenants to other projects, some data migration needs to happen
in the background. If you trigger a replication right after the release,
it might fail with an according error message. This should only be the case for a few minutes.

### Fix Optional Service Display During Tenant Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented selecting optional building block
services during tenant creation when you switched landing zones multiple times
while in the wizard.

### Event Logs for Tag Definitions
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
meshStack now records event logs for any changes to Tag Definitions.
Administrators can review these changes in the admin area.

### Improved input/output type checking for building blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've improved how type mismatches between parent and child building blocks are handled. 
Previously, if a child building block depended on a parent's output, but the types didn't 
match, the child would get stuck. Now, the system clearly indicates which parent building 
block failed, making it easier for operators to diagnose and fix the issue.

### Fix Platform Tenant ID for OSB tenants
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The platform tenant ID for OSB tenants was not shown in meshPanel. This is fixed now and the
ID should also be available for all OSB tenants now.

### Arrange tag values vertically instead of horizontally
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Tag values are now arranged vertically instead of horizontally, i.e, one
below the other instead of side-by-side. This change was introduced to avoid
that tag values are cut off if the available screen width is insufficient to
display all tag values.

### Fix Building Block operator default value not saved
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented saving inputs of type operator input for a Building Block
if the value was provided as a default value and was not changed.

### Fix HTTP 500 when null value inside a tag specification
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug which resulted in a HTTP 500 if you provided a null value in a tag
specification when interacting with the meshObject API.

### Prevent project user access with expired workspace role
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously only the project binding and its expiration controlled if a user was able to access a cloud project. 
The behavior was now improved so if a workspace role for a user or group expires they will also loose access for 
the cloud tenants inside this workspace, just as if their project role has expired. Please remember to check the 
expiration date for your workspace users.
This also affects the users listed in a Building Block input.

### API Keys with admin permissions
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This release introduces "Admin permissions" for API Keys. 
Admin permissions grant an API key access to meshObjects in all workspaces specific list/update/delete operations. 
This release adds new admin permissions for meshProjects.

#### How to use
Only admins can add admin permissions to new and existing API keys via the Admin Area. 
Workspace Owners can review these admin permissions and revoke them if necessary. However, Workspace Owners cannot 
add new admin permissions to an existing API key.
The new "permissions" column in the API key list view allows admins to quickly identify keys 
with these privileged permissions.

### Fixes error when bulk deleting dependent Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When you selected multiple Building Blocks and tried to delete them while one was a child of 
the other an internal server error occurred. This has been fixed.

### Fix Building Blocks not sourced from Azure DevOps
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixes a bug that prevented Building Blocks hosted on Azure DevOps Repos from being sourced correctly.

### Fix Missing Role Recertification Notification
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, if a large group of users had role recertifications on the same day, some users did not receive the 
reminder notifications. This issue has now been fixed and all users should receive their reminders as expected.

### Read meshTagDefinitions via meshObject API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API now supports reading tag definitions for objects in your meshStack.
For more information, please check the meshTagDefinitions section of the API documentation.

### Platform Types Moved to Platforms as a Tab
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We've enhanced navigation by moving Platform Types from the sidebar menu to the Platforms section. Now, you can easily access platform types as a tab.

### Fix Role Assignment during Azure Replication
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A regression that was introduced with the last release caused the role assignment during Azure replication to fail in some cases.
The change has been reverted and the role assignment should work as expected again.

### Removal of double-click deletion confirmation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
For some deletion actions in meshStack you can find a small deletion button where the deletion had to be confirmed by
clicking on this small button again. This was not always clear to users and we have removed this interaction in favor
of an explicit dialog where confirmation will be asked. This should improve the user experience when deleting items
in meshStack.

### Fixes input type detection for Terraform
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
A bug prevented the proper detection of input types when using the Terraform auto-import
feature while setting up a Building Block Definition.

### Extend meshObject API with meshWorkspaceUserBindings
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API was extended to support the creation, deletion and
retrieval of meshWorkspaceUserBindings via the imperative meshObject API
endpoints (as opposed to the declarative meshObject API endpoints).

#### How to use
The documentation for the new API endpoints is available in our meshObject
API documentation, below the meshProjectGroupBinding. For now, this
functionality is only available for API users, and not for API keys. Support
for API keys will follow in a subsequent release.

### Consistent 'errorCode' field in API responses
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack API responses now consistently include an 'errorCode' field that describes
the nature of the error. Clients can use this field to differentiate errors that 
share the same HTTP status code without parsing the error's 'message' field.

### Project Binding Version 3 in meshObject Declarative Import
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
For the meshObject API, the API version 3 was recently introduced for
meshProjectUserBindings and meshProjectGroupBindings. So far, this new
version could only be used for the imperative API endpoints. Now, the new
version can also be used for the declarative meshObject API endpoints.

### Fix Terraform object output breaking Building Block update
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug which prevented the proper updating of a Building Block run if 
a Terraform based Building Block returned an object output.

### Fix missing query parameters in meshusers link
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, the meshusers link in the response payload returned by the
meshObject API was in some cases missing required query parameters. For
example, when requesting a single workspace, the meshusers link did not
include the workspaceIdentifier. This issue has now been resolved.

### Improved whitespace detection in deletion dialogs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In case you had whitespaces in your Building Block name the deletion could fail when
the name was entered in the security question dialog. The whitespace detection was
improved so you can now delete the affected entities.

### Removes duplicate Save buttons
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This slightly improves the UI and removes the duplicate save button
from the workspace and project tag menu in the admin area.

### Self-service update of Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** Partner, Customer, User<br>

#### Description
User Inputs of Building Blocks can now also be updated by workspace users. Before the change
only operators of the Building Block were able to update the inputs. Operators can decide which
of the User Inputs can be updated as there might be some inputs that cannot be changed, because the Building
Block could not handle the update of such an input. All already existing inputs have been set to
"not updatable". So if you already own a Building Block Definition for which you would like to give your
workspace users the ability to update a User Input, you can change the "User Input editing permissions"
on the Building Block Input and release a new version of your Building Block Definition.

#### How to use
Workspace users can switch to the Edit Mode for inputs in the Tenant Control Plane where Building Blocks
are listed. They can then update the inputs that are configured for update, or they can run
the Building Block again without applying any change.

### Include Project Name in User Bindings and Group Bindings
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshProjectUserBindings and meshProjectGroupBindings returned via the
meshObject API now includes the project name in addition to the project
identifier.

#### How to use
In the API response, the project name can be found in the
targetRef.displayName property.

### Introducing Building Block Event Logs
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
With this update, we've introduced Building Block event logs on the "Event Logs" page. Now you can track key actions related to the Building Block, including when the Building Block is created, deleted, and when a new run of the building block is requested. Additionally, the event logs capture the reason behind each run request, providing better visibility and traceability.

### Enforce Restriction of meshCustomer APIs Usage
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
As announced, we are deprecating meshCustomer API endpoints. As
meshCustomer was renamed to meshWorkspace, you have to use the meshWorkspace endpoints now.
This also affects meshObjects used in the meshObject import endpoint. If you still use a meshCustomer
endpoint or meshObject you will now get an error message. If you have any questions please 
contact support@meshcloud.io

### Enforce Versioned Accept Header for API
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
As announced, we deprecated calling the meshStack API without a versioned Accept
header from Sep 2024 on. We are now enforcing it to prevent
new integrations with the API without providing the version in the Accept header.
If users still use an API endpoint without the Accept Header they will now get an error message. 
If you have any questions please contact support@meshcloud.io

#### How to use
Please be aware, that the Accept header is also required when you call a POST or PUT endpoint. 
This information is now included in the API documentation. Following the updated API docs will 
ensure your requests work correctly.

### Metering Configuration Transparency
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've added metering configuration status to make it easier for you to independently verify and troubleshoot your metering 
configuration. On the Platform Page in the Admin area under the "Metering Status" column, you can now see if your metering 
configuration is not defined, pending, failed, or successful. Please stay tuned as we will add details about errors
that occurred during collection as well as notifications about the failed status and visibility of it on 
the action needed section of the Dashboard.

### Simplification for Expiration Date Changes
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, if the 4-eyes principle was enabled in your 
meshStack for requesting access to a Workspace or Project, 
you also needed extra approvals from other users to change 
an expiration date. Now changing the expiration date will 
be processed instantly, without needing additional approvals 
even if the 4-eyes principle enabled for your meshStack.

### Fix Prices per month
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Changes to prices for Platforms, Building Blocks, and OSBs defined in meshStack are from now on only valid from 
the current month on. That means that even if a chargeback statement is regenerated in a following month, where 
prices were already modified, the prices for Platforms, Building Blocks, and OSBs will stay as they were at the 
end of the period of the chargeback statement.

### Removal of Provider information in Location
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have removed the "Provider" feature, which previously allowed you to set a name,
description, URL, and logo to display alongside your platform instance. If you are using the Provider feature we
have reached out to you a few weeks ago, so if you have not been notified there is no impact on your platforms.
For those that were using the Provider feature, we now directly integrated similar information on the platform itself.
You can see this information when you open a platform in the marketplace.
This includes the following migrations: The provider name is not migrated,
as it typically mirrors the platform name. The provider description will
only be migrated if your platform does not already have a description.
Custom logos are not supported, so the logo URL will not be migrated.
The website URL will be migrated only if your platform does not already have a support URL.
No action is required from you, as these changes will be handled automatically.
This update is part of our effort to simplify platform management and improve the overall user experience.

### Manual Building Block Step Update Fix
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, the step status for the Manual Building Block was not updated correctly, despite the successful completion of the Building Block. This issue is now resolved and the step status is updated after the successful execution.

### Fix for Terraform Building Blocks Source Checkout
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
We resolved a bug affecting Terraform Building Blocks where the specified git refName 
in the Building Block Definition was not properly respected during execution. 
Previously, this caused sources to always be checked out from the latest state on the default branch, 
rather than the intended reference. With this fix, the correct git refName is now correctly considered, 
ensuring that the specified branch, tag, or commit is accurately used when checking out the source.

### Fix live logs for Terraform Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Logs for steps of a Terraform Building Block Run are now updated
live again instead of only at the end of each step.

### Failed Tenant Creation No Longer Blocks Deletion
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when a tenant replication failed during its creation, neither the tenant nor its associated project could be deleted in meshStack. This issue has now been resolved.

### Set Project to Active on Tenant Deletion Rejection
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when a project was submitted for deletion, its associated tenants were also automatically submitted for deletion. If one of the tenant deletions was rejected, the project would remain in a "Deletion pending" state. This issue has now been resolved. The project is now set back to an "active" status, allowing it to be resubmitted for deletion after the submitter has resolved the provided comments or cleaned up the rejected tenant.

### Fixed Long Tag Value Display Issue
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, long tag values appeared broken, causing misalignment or truncation in the UI. In this release long tag values 
will now wrap or truncate gracefully, ensuring they are rendered correctly without breaking the layout.

### Limit Maximum Number of Tag Definitions
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This release introduces a limit on the maximum number of tag definitions that admins can create.
The default value for this limit is 256 tag definitions across all taggable meshObject types. 
We introduce this change to prevent possible performance issues when using a large number of tag
properties and prepare introduction of tags in the meshObject API.

### Show logs for failed Building Block Run steps
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed a bug that did not show logs for failed
steps of a Building Block Run. Starting with this release
all steps include their respective logs independently from the
status of the steps.

### Timeout Increased for Building Block Runs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
An internal change in the communication between services made it necessary
to increase the timeout for building block runs, the previous timeout was
too short and could lead to double execution of runs if the Terraform script
execution took too long.

### Provide Detailed Status on Building Blocks
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
This powerful new capability enables Platform Engineers to deliver detailed execution information for a Building Block to its consumers. Using the new BuildingBlockRuns API endpoint, you can provide real-time updates on runs and individual steps, displaying progress or offering detailed error reports to users and operators.

Please note that this functionality is currently in BETA. If you have any feedback, feel free to reach out.

### Misleading Required Tag Indicator Fixed
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've fixed an issue where optional tags showed a red stripe for empty field, implying they were required. Now, the red stripe 
only appears for required fields or invalid input and will no longer show for empty optional fields.

### Skip Azure Resource Check on Subscription deletion
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When meshStack cancels an Azure subscription, Azure sometimes returns an error if the subscription 
still contains resources. This prevents tenant deletion from completing successfully in meshStack. 
We now instruct Azure to ignore existing resources when deleting a subscription. In the event that 
operators need to recover resources deleted this way, they can undo the subscription deletion in 
Azure until a few days after the cancellation.

### Fix update of static Building Block Definition input files
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When you tried to update a file of a static Building Block Definition input, the Save button was still disabled
and the new file was not saved. This issue has been fixed and after you click the Save button, the new file is also
persisted.

### Fix Default Value for Single-Select Tags
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we've resolved an issue where predefined default values for single-select tags were not being applied in 
certain edge cases. With this fix, the default value will now be correctly pre-selected when specified, ensuring it serves 
as the default option if no user selection is made.

### Fix deletion of mandatory Building Block Definition
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
If a Building Block Definition was defined as mandatory on a Landing Zone and a Building Block with this definition existed,
the deletion of the Building Block Definition was not possible. The deletion of the Building Block was triggered, but could
never be updated and therefore even no new run for the deletion of the Building Block appeared. This issue is fixed now. You
can successfully delete the Building Block Definition and the Building Block.

### Increase retry timeout for AWS Control Tower deployment
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
The retry timeout for AWS Control Tower deployment has been increased from 15 minutes to 20 minutes.
This change is to accommodate the time it takes for AWS Control Tower to deploy resources.

### Improved Tenant Created Event Logging
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when tenants were created during Project creation, the tenant creation event was only recorded within the associated 
Project's event log. In this release, tenant creation events are now logged separately, even when they are created as part of a 
Project.

### Live Updates for Building Block Status Now Available
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now see live updates for your in-progress building blocks automatically loaded on the tenant control plane. This ensures that you stay informed about the status of your orders in real time.

### Support Pinned Azure Devops Repositories in Building Blocks
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When using the Azure DevOps Building Blocks, pinning the version was not effective.
This means that if you used a repository with a specific version, it always used the default branch.
This issue has been fixed.

### Fix Error Messages Not Shown in Building Block Runs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
In some cases, building block runs failed without showing an error message.
This issue has been fixed.

### Make Terraform Runner timeouts configurable
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, only global timeouts were configurable in Terraform Runner and others were hardcoded.
Now, timeouts for terraform init command and terraform workspace operations are also configurable.
If you are running into timeouts during terraform init or workspace operations, you can now request an increase in timeout values.

### Multi-Select Dropdown for Status Columns
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A new multi-select dropdown has been introduced to enhance the user experience in the Admin Area across various 
pages, including Projects, and Payment Methods. This component allows users to efficiently filter and manage different statuses, 
providing a more streamlined and comprehensive overview.

### Fixed Users with Same Email Not Shown in Search
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously in the meshStack access control, the search function only showed one user when multiple users shared 
the same email address. This has now been fixed, and the updated search algorithm correctly displays all users associated with 
the same email.

### Improved logging for Terraform Runner
**Audience:** Partner, User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when a terraform run failed, there were no error messages in the logs. This made it difficult to diagnose the issue. 
Now, the logs will contain the error message, making it easier to identify the problem.

### Improve performance of background jobs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In some environments background jobs like service instance polling or service instance provisioning/deprovisioning
took unexpectedly long. We improved the way these background jobs are executed and expect them to run more reliably
now, which results in quick executions of e.g. service instance operations.

### Improve performance of policy evaluation
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Policies defined in meshStack are evaluated hourly and if any violations are found, they are persisted.
Additionally policies are evaluated against certain workspaces if e.g. users are added or removed, projects
are deleted, etc. The evaluation did sometimes take unexpectedly long and did slow down operations like a 
project deletion where policies are evaluated. The issue is fixed now and the slow operations should not
occur anymore.

### Show Correct Report Category for CO2 Cost Line Items
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, line items in a chargeback statement returned by the
meshChargeback API always had the reportCategory attribute set to BILLING,
even if the costs of that line item were denominated in kgCO2e (kilograms of
carbon dioxide equivalent). This was fixed, so that line items that describe
environmental costs have the reportCategory set to ENVIRONMENTAL.

### Improve error message for duplicate tag keys
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Error messages for duplicate tag keys when working on the tags in the Admin Area were improved.
More details are now provided on why there is a conflict and how to resolve it.

### Fix Display Name of Building Block Definition IO
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you update the display name of a Building Block Definition Input or Output, the display name was not set correctly and was always auto-generated based on the name of the input/output. This is fixed now.

### Terraform Logs are shown under Logs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
During the recent rework of our logging system, Terraform logs were mistakenly displayed under the "Remarks" section. This issue has now been resolved, and logs will appear under "Logs" again.

### Fix Building Blocks with SSH Auth
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
With Release 2024.35.0 a regression was introduced that prevented successful execution of Building Blocks
that used SSH to access Terraform Modules in a Git repository. This issue is fixed now and these Building Blocks
run successfully.

#### How to use
Building Block Runs that were stuck in an In Progress or Pending state after Release 2024.35.0 will automatically
run through with this fix. No manual interaction is needed.

### Fix deletion of "Waiting for Dependency" Building Block
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
It was not possible to delete a Building Block that was in status "Waiting for Dependency". You received an error,
that the Building Block cannot be deleted, when it is in that status. This was a wrong validation made by meshStack
and is fixed now. You can now also successfully delete those Building Blocks.

### Support for OpenTofu in Building Blocks
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With this release, Building Blocks now support OpenTofu for Terraform versions greater than 1.5.5.
OpenTofu is a fork of Terraform that is open-source, community-driven, and managed by the Linux Foundation.

#### How to use
You can now enter Terraform versions in your Building Blocks that exceed version 1.5.5. If so, meshStack
will automatically run your code with OpenTofu rather than Terraform. Existing or new Building Blocks that
use version 1.5.5 or lower will still run with Terraform.

### Fix project deletion with long running policy evaluations
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If a lot of policies are active in a meshStack and their evaluation for big workspaces takes
a long time, errors could have occurred during project and tenant deletion. This is fixed now
and should result in a quick response when marking a project for deletion. The policy evaluation
is now executed asynchronously in the background afterwards.

### Fixed User Sync Issue in meshObject Import
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've addressed an issue that could occur during meshObject imports, where certain users were not correctly synced to their 
respective groups within meshStack. This fix ensures that the import process now updates all users successfully.

### Fixed Duplicate Cost Center Issue During Workspace Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we fixed an issue where creating a new workspace would fail on the first attempt, but succeed on the 
second without clarity. This happens if the given cost center is already associated with another workspace. Now, a clear 
information will be displayed, informing you and allowing you to proceed confidently if you choose.

### Allow Building Block updates during a run execution
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, an update to a Building Block and its inputs failed to trigger a run in case
there was already an active run. This is now fixed, so incoming updates are properly queued and executed 
after the active run.

### Fix links to API docs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the API Users view in the Admin Area, links to API documentation were pointing to the wrong url.
This is now fixed.

### Prepare Building Block updates via external systems
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We improved the execution of Building Blocks to enable external system like a Github Actions pipeline to send 
updates to Building Block Runs. The API to send these updates will be available soon.

### Markdown Support for Customizable Pages
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Admins can now enter markdown in the description field for the Welcome Page & Landing Page in meshStack. The
markdown will then be formatted and shown to users on the respective page. For example, you can now add links, bold text,
code formatting, and much more based on the Markdown specification.

### Change AWS OU, Azure MG, and GCP folders for landing zones
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, you could not change a landing zone's management group, OU or folder after the landing zone was created. Now, you can update these settings in the landing zone configuration.

### Fix upgrade option for draft Building Blocks
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When you created a Building Block based on a draft version of a Building Block Definition
and the Definition also had already released versions, the "Upgrade" button was available for
the Building Block, even though it was already on the latest draft version. This is fixed now
and there is no option anymore to upgrade a Building Block that is based on a draft Definition
version.

### Improve performance when loading Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** Customer, User, Partner<br>

#### Description
When you created many versions for a Building Block Definition or even for multiple Building
Block Definitions it took a long time to load the Building Block Definitions, e.g. for the
overview in the Admin Area. Also other Building Block related screens were affected. Performance
of this is improved now. We will continue improving it further, but with this first step, especially
environments with many Definitions that have a lot of versions should notice a clear performance boost.

### Enable/Disable manual user invites via self-service
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This feature adds the option to disable manual user invitations in the admin area
management settings menu. Previously you had to enable SCIM to disable manual user invitations.
But if you managed users via the meshObject API and also wanted to disable manual user invitations
this was not easily possible. Now you can use this setting to prevent manual user invites.

### Performance optimization for project deletion
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When deleting a project with all its tenants either via meshObject API
or directly via the panel, the deletion process should now be much faster.

### Enforce versioned Accept Header for API in QA Environments
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
As announced, we will deprecate calling the meshStack API without a versioned Accept
header from Sep 1st, 2024 on. We are now enforcing this in your QA environments to prevent
new integrations with the API without providing the version in the Accept header.

#### How to use
Please be aware, that the Accept header is also required when you call a POST or PUT endpoint. 
This information is now included in the API documentation. Following the updated API docs will 
ensure your requests work correctly.

### Workspace Name Instead of IDs in Notifications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, notification emails displayed the Workspace 
identifier. Based on your feedback, we have replaced the
Workspace identifier with the Workspace name, making it 
easier to identify the Workspace where an action occurred.

### No longer show variable name in Building Block Configuration
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
A few releases ago we introduced display names for Building Block Definitions so users have more easy-to-read
names when configuring their Building Block Definitions. Besides that we also showed the underlying variable name
next to it. To reduce the information shown to the user, we now removed the variable name that was shown.
If you do still desire to show the variable name to your users for whatever reason, we recommend adding the 
variable name as brackets in the display name, e.g. "AWS Region (aws_region)".

### Markdown Support for Building Block Input Descriptions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
As an owner of a Building Block Definition, you can now use Markdown in Building Block Input Descriptions. This allows you to e.g. add links
or other rich text formatting like bold or italic text in the description.

#### How to use
Simply enter text that is supported by the Markdown standard and it will be rendered to the user upon creating a new 
building block. For example: Built with **love** by [meshcloud](meshcloud.io).

### Fix Converted Amounts for Projects with CO2 values
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, currency conversion was not working in chargebacks that included
both monetary values and CO2 values. This has now been fixed, and monetary
amounts are correctly converted to EUR in chargebacks that also include CO2
values.

### Rare replication issues with special characters in username
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug which led to rare replication failure when for example
a user with a special character in his name was present on the tenant.
Not all meshStacks were affected by this bug.

### Pending Deletion Projects in Workspace Deletion Process
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when deleting a Workspace with Tenants and Projects from the Admin Area, the link to check for stale Projects 
showed only active ones, which was confusing if there were also pending deletion Projects for this Workspace. With the fix, 
clicking the link now displays both active and pending deletion Projects, ensuring clear visibility on all associated Projects 
for Workspace removal.

### Add API documentation for API Key login
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The /api/login endpoint to get an access token with your API Key is now available in the API docs.
This endpoint is also part of the Postman collection and the OpenAPI docs now. This enables an easy
approach for testing the API calls with your API Key. The docs describe in detail how to use API keys
and how to authenticate with them.

### Fix for meshBuildingBlocks deletion API
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previous to this change, the deletion endpoint for meshBuildingBlocks
would always only purge the meshBuildingBlock from meshStack without
respecting the deletion mode on the Building Block's definition version.
The deletion mode is now correctly considered.

There is also a new endpoint to enforce purging of a meshBuildingBlocks.
API Users can only use the new endpoint if the administrative right for
deleting Building Blocks was assigned to them.

### Fix Highlight Changes for Platform Configuration Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the Event Logs section inside the Admin Area, platform configuration
changes are shown in a diff view that conveniently highlights all changes,
with deletions shown in red and additions shown in green. Previously, this
diff view was only available for recently created events. Now, this diff view
is also used for older events.

### Broken display name for building block inputs/outputs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a display bug which only displayed a repeated name for building block
inputs and outputs when multiple of such inputs/outputs were present in a single
building block.

### Improved Visibility for Pending Tenant and Project Deletions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, it wasn't clear to users when a Project or Tenant deletion was still 
pending, meaning required approval from the admin. Now, application team members 
can clearly see when Projects and Tenants are awaiting deletion, making it 
transparent why immediate deletion isn't possible and which resources are pending 
deletion.

### Fixed Notification for Granted or Revoked Permissions
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when users were added or removed from Workspace or Project
bindings via the API, affected users received a notification indicating that
the change was made by admin@meshcloud.io. This has been fixed, the
notification now correctly states that the change was made via API.

### Improved Validation for Role Expiration Dates
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have enhanced the validation for workspace role expiration dates to prevent errors. Previously, it was possible to enter 
expiration dates that exceeded the predefined maximum limits set in Admin compliance, which led to issues. Now, when a date 
exceeds the maximum allowable expiration date, a validation error is displayed immediately, ensuring compliance and preventing 
potential errors.

### Modal for Role Assignment only shows if necessary
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
In some edge cases, when assigning a workspace or a project role to a user, a
modal was shown that required the user to enter a reason explaining why that
role is required, even if 4-eyes principle was not active. This was fixed, so
that this modal is now displayed only if 4-eyes principle is enabled.

### Performance Improvement when Loading Workspaces
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, we observed long loading times when loading a list of workspaces,
for example, when you have selected a platform in the Admin Area, then went
to Settings and then to Restrictions, loading the workspace dropdown could
take a while. This has been fixed.

### Adds missing tags for cloud platform replication
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fix adds the tags related to the owner, additional owner and payment method amount
to the list of usable tags (it was already available in a drop-down when setting up the 
tags mapping in the admin area but they were non-functional).
This also includes updates to the documentation for those tags.
If you used the landing zone name or identifier as tags before (which also did not work 
and is fixed now) please correct the key in your platform configuration from 
tenantLandingZone (or tenantLandingZoneIdentifier) to the now correct ones: landingZoneName 
and landingZoneIdentifier.

### Improves mandatory building block checks at tenant creation
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
A bug allowed the creation of tenants without the mandatory landing zone building block
when a slow network connection was present.
The validation logic was fixed to prevent such incomplete creation requests from getting
accepted.

### Role Expiration Date Handling
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, it was possible to enter past dates to the workspace or project role expiration dates and only after adding the role, an 
error was shown. We now already show a validation error when a date from the past is chosen in the first place.

### Projects Default Quota Issue Resolved
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have identified and fixed an issue affecting meshStacks setup or project default quota modified since February 2024. This issue caused the 
defined projects default quota to not be applied correctly, defaulting Project quotas to 1 instead. With this release, the default 
quota will now be applied as intended.

### Prevent duplicate localIds of Service Instances
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It was possible to create Service Instances with the same localId, if they belonged to different
Service Plans. As the OSB specification defines the localId as a globally unique ID, we now changed
this to make sure that the localIds are unique within a meshStack. This prevents potential issues
with Service Brokers that rely on localIds not only being unique within one service, but really 
globally.

### Improve messaging around required workspace role expirations
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Creating a new workspace requires at least one user with the workspace owner role.
If this role requires an expiration date to be set it will now be validated during workspace access assignment instead of leading to a technical error message during the actual workspace creation.

### Improve performance of project overview in admin area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In some environments the project overview in the admin area did load very slowly. This has been fixed
now and the page will load quickly.

### Fixed Expiration Date Issue in Workspace Access
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, while assigning a new user or group role in Workspace Access that required an expiration date, multiple incorrect 
requests are opened. In this release, this issue has been resolved. Also a tooltip has been added to remind users not to input 
dates in the past when assigning new user or group roles in workspace access.

### Streamlined Tenant Control Plane Navigation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have integrated items previously located in the sidebar of the "Overview" on the tenant control plane into a single, streamlined view. You will now immediately see the Console and the Building Blocks upon accessing the control plane, simplifying the workflow by making essential functionalities readily accessible. Additionally, in an upcoming release, we plan to remove the Console/CLI access buttons from the tenant overview on the project control plane, as they will now be instantly accessible.

### Fix creation of Service Instances via API Key
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, the creator of the service did not add the "Originating Identity" header to the Service Broker-related HTTP requests, and the creation of a service instance could be scoped to a different workspace than the API key's. Both issues have been fixed, ensuring the "Originating Identity" header is now properly included and service instances are correctly scoped to the same workspace as the API key.

### Fix deletion of dependent Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
In rare cases it could have happened that the deletion of a Building Block Definition that has a dependency
to another Building Block Definition, led to an error, that the related Definition could not be deleted,
even though the dependent Definition should not be touched in that case. This issue is fixed now and you can
successfully delete the Building Block Definition.

### Fix notifications for in-landing-zone-only Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Users who were added to the notification subscribers of a Building Block Definition with the "Use in Landing Zone only" flag,
did not receive notifications about failed Building Blocks and Building Blocks that require operator input.
This is fixed now.

### Improve Project and Tenant deleted event authors
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Deleted Project and Tenant events often had admin@meshcloud.io set as the author. This is caused
by the asynchronous behavior of the deletion. We now improved this and always set the user who
requested the Project deletion also as an author of the final deletion. For Tenant deletion events
we now set either the user who approved the tenant deletion, if an approval is required, or otherwise 
the requesting user. With this change, events can be better assigned to the user who did the last action
that led to the final deletion of a tenant or project.

### Fix Open Repository Link Button Visibility
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The "Open Repository" button was not always displayed when accessing a Building Block Definition of the implementation type 
"Terraform", even if the repository URL matched the required criteria. We have fixed the issue to ensure that the "Open Repository" 
button is always displayed when you open a Building Block Definition with a repository URL that matches the criteria set during 
definition.

### Fixes slow API responses with API keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixes a problem that made API responses very slow when using API keys.

### Disable Update Quotas for Tenants Pending Deletion
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A bug was identified where quota requests could not be updated for tenants marked for deletion. When attempting to update 
quotas, users encountered errors with no further action. In this release the "Update Quotas" button is now disabled for tenants 
pending deletion to prevent errors. Users can only manage quotas once the deletion status is resolved.

### Fix "Use in Landing Zone only" Building Blocks as dependency
**Audience:** Partner, Operator, Customer<br>

#### Description
If you defined a dependency to a "Use in Landing Zone only" Building Block Definition from another
Building Block Definition, you could not set this dependency when you wanted to add a new Building Block
via the marketplace. This is fixed now and you can successfully create your Building Block that has
a dependency to another Building Block, which is configured for "Use in Landing Zone only".

### New users EUID missing on initial login
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If an upstream IDP was used for identity management under rare conditions
users might not get their EUID set properly on the initial login into the panel,
which required a second login to resolve.
This fix now performs a user sync with Keycloak upon initial login to correctly
set the EUID reliably.
It also fixes a bug that could lead to errors during login if a user profile had 
incomplete Keycloak information.

### Fixes an issue in the deployment
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes a deployment issue that leads to an incomplete deployment.

### Explicit right to import tenants
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We added a new right to explicitly permit the import of existing
tenants into meshStack. This was previously possible for
workspace scoped API keys, but the new right is now only
available for API users. The new right needs to be added
to all existing API Users, that are used to import tenants 
via the new tenant POST endpoint. The declarative import is
not affected by this change!

### Fix Building Bocks with Operator input via API
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Building Blocks that have an operator input defined could not be created via the API. Creation led
to an error. This issue is fixed now and these Building Blocks can now be created successfully via API
and Terraform Provider.

### Improve tenant replication when removing a workspace user
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
If a workspace has many projects, removing multiple users from the workspace led to a long
queue of tenant replications within this workspace. This resulted in also other delayed tenant
replications. This issue has been fixed now and less tenant replications are triggered. This also
allows other replications to be executed much quicker.

### Enhance resilience of daily tenant replication
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
In rare cases an error when triggering tenant replication for all tenants once a day led to stopping
this daily replication. Therefore some tenants could have been excluded from the daily replication.
This is fixed now and all tenants will be replicated, even if some fail.

### Exclude expired roles from Building Block User Permissions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With the Assignment Type 'User Permissions' you can provide Building Blocks with the information on the project assigned user's including their respective project roles. Previously, expired roles were included in these permissions. This has been fixed.

### Tracking usage of API keys
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now see when an API key was last used to access resources in the new "Last Login" column. This should help you proactively manage your active API keys.

### Prevent User Deletion via UI when SCIM enabled
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, users could be deleted via the UI even when SCIM Management was enabled. This issue has been fixed to maintain SCIM as the authoritative source of truth when active.

### Fix Handling optional Single Select Fields
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, you encountered difficulty saving tags of a Building Block Definition when an optional single select field had no selected value. This has been fixed. Now, you can leave optional single select fields empty while editing your tags. Additionally, we have fixed an incorrect behavior where optional single select fields were erroneously indicated with a red bar, implying an issue when no selection was made. This misleading indicator has been corrected to accurately reflect the field's optional status.

### Remove Web Console Link on Building Block Deletion
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, if you specified an output with an Assignment Type 'Sign In URL' and deleted the associated building block, the link to the tenant would persist, resulting in a broken page. This issue has now been resolved; deleted building blocks will no longer leave behind links on the platform tenant dashboard.

### Fix API Key secret rotation
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that set the wrong secret when an API Key was rotated,
which led to essentially breaking the API Key.
Secret rotation now works correctly.

### Improvements on Replication Status Update
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fix drops duplicated replication requests instead of letting their
error override the legitimate status of the previous replication.
Duplicated replications can only happen under rare circumstances caused by internal
processes.

### Tenants from deleted platform now daily retried
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A bug prevented tenants from deleted platforms to be included in the nightly 
replication.
A tenant is purged if the platform is deleted in which it existed. With this
fix such tenants are retried and can be successfully removed from meshStack.

### Policies between Projects and Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now also define Policies between Projects and Building Block Definitions. These Policies will make
sure that you cannot create Building Blocks from that Definition in non-compliant projects. You will also
not see non-compliant Building Block Definitions anymore in the Marketplace within the Tenant Control Plane.
Additionally you cannot pick an non-compliant project when you choose a Building Block Definition
from the Marketplace on workspace level.

### Add Event Author in Notifications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, notifications only mentioned the author as "Admin" when informing meshStack users about changes such as role revocations, assignments to Workspaces/Projects, or role changes. With this update, users will now see the exact email address of the person responsible for the action in the notification, providing greater clarity and transparency.

### Fix for expired roles triggering excessive replications
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that could trigger a lot of unnecessary project replications
if a lot of expired roles were present. This reduces the load on the system during
nightly project replications.

### Support Dots in Payment Method Identifiers
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this fix, we now again support payment method identifiers with dots, enabling parameter modifications via API for 
these identifiers.

### Manage project user- and group-bindings via meshObject API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Adds the option to add, remove and list project user and group bindings
via the meshObject API. The bindings are used to grant access to projects
for user and user groups.

### Fix User Group Search under Workspace Access Control
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, under Workspace access control, you couldn't search for user groups with underscores in their names or identifiers, which hindered the ability to assign groups to your Workspaces. This issue has now been fixed.

### Improvement of Payment Method Overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we've improved the payment method overview in the Admin Area. The "Expiration Status" column is now 
"Status," and we've added a "deleted" status for better clarity and sorting. Also, deleted payment methods are automatically 
sorted out when you enter the screen, providing a clear overview of the current state without overloading you with historical data.

### Improved Feedback for Azure Subscription Provisioning
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When provisioning Azure subscriptions meshStack now returns more helpful
feedback messages to users for expected transient error conditions like
Azure's APIs not finding the newly created subscription. The tenant now
retains a "Pending" replication state until the condition is resolved.

### Fix nightly replication
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Due to a previous bug that was present in meshStack since version 2024.28.1
the nightly replication of all tenants was not working as expected anymore.
This bug has been removed.
Also we fixed a case of tenants being replicated twice and the second replication
ending up with an error message "tenant failed to replicate".

### Restrict notifications for landing zone only building blocks
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
For landing zone only building blocks successful notifications are not sent anymore. Only the operator will receive notifications for failed building blocks or when an input is required.

### Improve nightly replication
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This change prevents a rare timing issue that could possibly lead to double tenant replications being issued 
for meshStacks with a high number of tenants inside a platform.

### Fix Building Block Definition Input Copy on Draft Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, creating a draft version did not copy the selectable and default values from the latest version. This issue has now been fixed.

### Display name for Building Block Definition Input
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've enhanced our UI that allows you to provide display names for inputs. During your input configuration, input names such as "CLIENT_SECRET" will auto-generates a more human-readable name like "Client Secret" as an display name. For even greater clarity and customization, you can also specify your own display name or modify the auto-generated one to better suit your needs.

### Fix for Building Block List in Workspace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we have resolved an issue with the building block endpoint. Previously, the endpoint only provided building blocks if the building block definition was also owned by the same workspace. This issue has been addressed, and now the API correctly provides all building blocks for the specified workspace or project.

### Fix group deletion on failed group replications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when the group replications failed, it inadvertently triggers group deletion. This has been fixed.

### Manage Service Instances with API keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now use your API keys to manage service instances
within your workspace.

### Improve Notifications for Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You will now receive notifications immediately upon being added as subscribers to a Building Block Definition.

### Fix in Building Block list API
**Audience:** User<br>

Previously, you encountered an error when attempting to delete a building block definition that is mandatory in a landing zone on a deleted platform. This issue has been fixed.

### Building Block definition repos on Azure DevOps
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes a problem with private key formats that made it impossible to use Git repos hosted on Azure DevOps with SSH authentication for Building Block definitions.

### Visible Marketplace Applicable Policies
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we display active policies in the marketplace, if they exist. With this, you can see 
what policies apply to your marketplace. Note that some Platforms and Building Blocks may not be shown 
due to these policies.

### Manage Building Blocks with API Keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now use your API Keys to manage (create and delete) Building Blocks
within your workspace. More objects will be supported soon.

### Building Block Costs for Cloud Foundry and OpenStack
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when setting a price for BB related to OpenStack or Cloud
Foundry, that price didn't appear in the chargeback statement. This issue has
now been resolved.

### Event Logs Show Correct Author for Tenant Deletion
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when a Tenant was deleted by an application team member from a
Project, the corresponding Event Log entry showed incorrect email as the
author. This has been fixed, so that the actual username is shown instead.

### Service Instance Listing via API Key
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now list your service instances using your API key. To enable this functionality, ensure that the permission "List service instances on workspace" is added to your API key under Workspace Access > API Keys.

### Fix Confirmation Dialog for Purging OSB Service Instances
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When purging multiple OSB Service Instances, the confirmation dialog in meshPanel used
to keep information from the last purged instance. This issue has now been fixed.

### Recommended Services from the Landing Zone
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this update, application team members can now see recommended services for the landing zone selected.
The recommended services are presented as the last screen during the platform configuration process in Project 
or Tenant Creation. Recommended services can be referenced in the landing zone configuration by marking them 
"recommended".

### Deactivate platform types
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You are now able to deactivate platform types in the Admin Area. This allows you to clean up platform types that you don't use anymore.

### Improved Tenant Replication execution
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, rare cases existed where a replication was executed even if a request encountered an issue. 
This has now been resolved, so replication will only be triggered for successful requests.

### Open Repository Link Button
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have added a new button to the Building Block definition Terraform implementation. This button allows 
users to open the provided repository link directly from the interface, enhancing ease of access to 
repository resources with a click. Please note that this feature currently works only for GitHub, GitLab, and 
BitBucket, and is limited to cloud-hosted solutions, not those that are self-hosted.

### Fix Workspace Column in Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, there was a slight inconsistency in the Event Logs section within
the Admin Area for Platform Creation events. If the Platform was created
within the Admin Area, the Workspace column was not empty sometimes. This has
been fixed now.

### Fix Date Picker in Event Logs Section
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
For browsers that have been configured with non-German localization settings,
the date picker in the Event Logs section did not work correctly. This has
been fixed.

### Event Logs for Workspace Control Plane
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Recently, we have introduced the Event Logs page under the Compliance section in the Admin area. Now, you can find Event Logs also on the Workspace control plane under the Compliance section, so that teams can see all events related to their Workspace.

### Fix nested OUs for Control Tower enrollment
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
A bug prevented AWS accounts to get correctly enrolled in a nested Organizational
Unit. This has been fixed.

### Service Management Area is now opt-in
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when the service management area would be enabled on your meshStack, every single workspace manager would
see the "Service Management Area" button on the top-right of the workspace control plane. With this release, we now
made the availability of the Service Management Area an explicit opt-in before users see this button and area. Workspaces
that already offered one or more services from the Service Management Area automatically still have access.

#### How to use
In your workspace control plane go to "Settings -> General". Here you will find a new toggle where you can enable
the service management area for that particular workspace.

### Currency Conversion for Additional Currencies
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The currency codes CAD, TWD, INR and CNY (i.e., Canadian Dollar, New Taiwan
Dollar, Indian Rupee and Yuan Renminbi) have been added to the currencies
that meshStack converts to EUR. Customers who are not using any cloud
provider that provides cost data in those currencies will not be impacted by
this change. Customers that do receive cost data with those currencies can
now have their cost data converted from those currencies to EUR.
Please contact meshcloud support for more details if you wish to convert
those currencies to EUR.

### Fix Tag Changes in Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when changing the tags of a meshObject, such as a Workspace or
Project, an incorrect Event Log entry was generated in some circumstances.
If the meshObject contained multiple tags and only one of those tags was
changed, the Event Log incorrectly stated that all tags were changed, even
though only a single tag was modified. This is now fixed.

### Enables single tenant CA Subscription creations
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When the source and target AAD configuration setting matches for
Customer Agreement Subscription enrollments for Azure platforms
the Subscription ownership acceptance is skipped. This enables to
keep Subscription in the account they are originally created.

### Fix Building Block Link to unaccessible Building Block
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If you have access to a tenant from the Service Management Area, you can also see the Building Blocks of that tenant.
If you don't own the related Building Block Definition, you will now no longer have a link to the details of that Building
Block, because you are not allowed to access these details. They are only accessible for the Building Block Definition owner
and admins.

### Improve error message if OSB catalog cannot be parsed
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If the catalog of an OSB Service Broker cannot be parsed by meshStack, we now provide a more detailed
error message, so the operator of the Service Broker can resolve the issue in the catalog.

### Fixed approve/deny links in approval notification
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you received a notification for requested approval, you would run into an error upon clicking the "Approve" or "Deny" links. This problem is now solved.

### Improve performance and resilience of Service Instance list
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The list of service instances for operators of Service Brokers loaded rather slowly. It even failed
with an error, if the communication to the Service Broker did not work because of e.g. some network issue
or the Service Broker being down. Both issues are solved now and the list loads quickly and reliably.

### Improve Building Block Definition input/output error
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've enhanced the error message for inputs/outputs deletion that are still in use by building blocks. It now offers guidance on the affected inputs/outputs and their usage within the building blocks, so you can delete affected building blocks first before attempting to delete affected inputs/outputs.

### Feature toggle for API Keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We recently introduced API Keys as a new mechanism to
authorize with meshStacks API within a workspace scope.
We now added a configuration flag for your meshStack
that allows to disable or enable access to this 
functionality on the workspace level.
Disabling the functionality will prevent
application teams to create API keys in self-service.

### Table filters work with spaces
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, for some tables in the panel such as the Tenants table, filtering
did not work correctly when spaces were entered. This is now fixed.

### Improve meshStack robustness against high load
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There was an incident where database connections were maxed out, causing an unstable meshStack
for a small period of time. We have increased the connections to support handling more concurrent queries.

### Fixed mails sent with outdated information
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In rare cases, our users received emails with outdated information. This has been fixed.

### Fix receiving Quota Request notifications when unsubscribed
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug where users were not properly removed from quota request
notification subscriptions and continued to receive notifications. Those users
are now correctly unsubscribed and will no longer receive these type of notifications.

### Platform Deactivation in Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, the Event Log has shown incomplete information when a Platform
was deactivated. This has been fixed. This fix is also applied retroactively
for existing events, i.e., if a Platform was deactivated before this fix was
released, the corresponding event will now be shown correctly.

### Show Detailed TenantUsageReport only for Private Platforms
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when viewing a TenantUsageReport, the "more details" button was
shown even though the detailed page is only intended for private cloud
Platforms. The resulting detailed page then showed fewer entries than the
previously shown TenantUsageReport, and sometimes no entries at all.
This has been fixed by not showing this button unless the Platform is a
private cloud Platform.

### Fix display of total services in marketplace with policies
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When policies are active that restrict Landing Zones or Building Blocks, the total number
in the marketplace was not correct. This is fixed now.

### Bugfix for Saving Favorites in Panel
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, adding and removing favorites in the panel did not always work
correctly. For example, adding a new favorite could remove all previously
saved favorites. This has been fixed.

### Fixed Email Notification Issue for Project Deletion
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When a user marked a project for deletion that had several tenants and one of the tenants couldn't be marked for deletion, there was still a possibility that the other tenants could be marked correctly. In such cases, an email was sent to the Cloud Foundation team requesting deletion approval for those tenants, if manual action is required from the Cloud Foundation team. The project deletion workflow has been fixed. Now, an approval request for tenant deletion will only be sent if all tenants within the project can be successfully marked for deletion.

### Single Select and Default Value Saving Issue
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Recently we introduced the Single Select and Default values for Building Block Definition inputs.
We discovered a bug in this feature which caused given option values and default values not to be saved 
correctly in subsequent versions of the Building Block Definition. This issue has been fixed in the current release, 
ensuring that all values are saved properly when creating and updating Building Block Definition inputs.

### Fix survey popping up too often
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack might ask you sometimes for a quick rating between 1-5 by opening a small dialog. We fixed an issue where
this dialog would open more than once in a session.

### Reload tenant replication progress automatically
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
For workspace users in the project tenant list, the tenants will automatically be refreshed when they are having
an ongoing replication. This way you no longer have to manually refresh your browser to check in with replication
progress.

### Refresh workspace list on workspace creation as partner
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When you created a new workspace as a partner and assigned yourself to it, the new workspace
did not appear in the navigation bar at the top. This is fixed now and you can see the
new workspace directly after creation in the dropdown without requiring a page reload.

### Fix platform sign in URLs for AWS, GCP and OpenShift
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A bug in the last release caused meshPanel to no longer use tenant-specific
sign in URLs that redirect users directly into the web console for their cloud tenant.
This affected AWS, GCP, and OpenShift platforms.
This release restores the correct behavior.

### Tenant management for Landing Zone Contributors
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now see and manage the tenant lifecycle of tenants that are created under a landing zone
which you own. This only works if you are setup as a contributor workspace to a platform.

### Fix step 'Delete Groups' during the deletion of AWS tenant
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When a deletion of AWS tenant has been triggered, the replication to delete this tenant seems to be stuck at the 'Delete Groups' step with the information that the affected groups can't be deleted. This has been fixed.

### Introducing Landing Zone Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With this update, we've introduced new Landing Zone 
event logs on "Event Logs" page. Now, you can monitor 
all changes to Landing Zones, including also those 
within the Services Management Area of a dedicated 
Workspace.

### Transition and Improvement of Platform Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change, we've moved Platform logs to the "Event Logs" 
page and introduced new Platform event logs. This enhancement 
provides you with comprehensive tracking of all Platform changes, 
including those in the Services Management area of a dedicated 
Workspace.

### Hide incompliant Building Block Definitions in Marketplace
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
If policies between Workspaces and Building Block Definitions are defined, only compliant Definitions 
are shown in the Marketplace for a workspace. This improves the UX of the marketplace, as these Definitions
could not have been used by the Workspace anyway.

#### How to use
A common use-case for this is defining Business Units or similar as a Tag on Workspaces and Building Block Definitions
and restrict them via a Policy. In this scenario, some Definitions shall only be available to certain
Business Units. Other Business Units should not see the Definitions that are intended for other Business Units,
as they cannot use them.

### Define Policies from Workspace to Building Block
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now also possible to define a Policy from Workspace to Building Block. Tags of the Building Block are
defined on the related Building Block Definition. A good example for 
such a policy is e.g. a policy for a matching Business Unit on your Workspaces and Building Blocks.
That way, you can restrict certain Building Blocks to only Workspaces that belong to a certain Business Unit.

### Tags in Marketplace for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release we introduce tags in the Marketplace, starting with Building Blocks. This enhancement 
allows users to see detailed metadata, making it easier to select suitable components for projects and 
tenants' needs.

### Fix project list access with API Key
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, all requests to list projects for a workspace 
that were authenticated based on an API Key were not scoped to
the respective workspace, but would rather return all existing
projects. This bug has been fixed now.

### Improved Deletion Flow for Service Instances in Tenants
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we've enhanced the deletion flow for service instances in tenants to provide a clearer 
and more intuitive user experience. Now, deleting a service instance is as simple as clicking the bin 
icon. Upon clicking, a modal will prompt you to confirm the deletion instead of doing a "double click" 
on the bin.

### Fix project creation with Workspace to Landing Zone policy
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When you defined a Workspace to Landing Zone policy, the project creation did
not allow picking a Platform, even if the tags of a Landing Zone matched with the Workspace
tags. This issue is fixed now.

### Don't show incompliant Platforms in Marketplace
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
If policies between Workspaces and Landing Zones are defined, only Platforms that have at least one
compliant Landing Zone for a selected Workspace are shown in the Marketplace. If no Landing Zone exists,
or only Landing Zones, that don't match to Workspace according to the defined policies, the Platforms
are not shown in the marketplace anymore. This improves the UX of the marketplace, as these Platforms
could not have been used by the Workspace anyway. During Tenant creation, the user would not have been
able to select a Landing Zone and therefore could not have created a Tenant in the Platform.

#### How to use
A common use-case for this is defining Business Units or similar as a Tag on Workspaces and Landing Zones
and restrict them via a Policy. In this scenario, some Platforms shall only be available to certain
Business Units. Other Business Units should not see the Platforms that are intended for other Business Units,
as they cannot use them.

### Fix creation of Cloud Foundry default Organization Quota
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We fixed a bug where meshStack failed to create the default Organization Quota  
"meshstack-quota" in Cloud Foundry due to an error introduced when upgrading
our integration to use the Cloud Foundry v3 API.

#### How to use
When replicating a tenant to Cloud Foundry, meshStack creates:
- a Cloud Foundry organization for the meshStack workspace
- a Cloud Foundry Space for the meshStack tenant
- a Cloud Foundry Space Quota for the meshStack tenant quota
The Cloud Foundry organization also needs to have an org quota assigned. For this purpose,
meshStack creates a "meshstack-quota" that is effectively unlimited because meshStack
manages quotas individually on every Cloud Foundry Space instead of as an aggregate on the 
Cloud Foundry Organization level.

### Project Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Recently, we have introduced the Event Logs page under the Compliance section
in the Admin area. Now, this page has been extended to include Project Event
Logs in addition to the existing Workspace Event Logs. Stay tuned as we
continue to expand logs related to actions in Workspace, Project, Platform,
and Landing Zone into this page.

### Fix deprecated Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, Building Block Definitions owned by a workspace with several published versions were incorrectly shown as deprecated. Now, they are accurately displayed as published.

### Landing zone-only definitions not shown in Marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building Block Definitions marked as 'Use in Landing Zones only' were erroneously accessible in the Marketplace via the "Related to" section of a Platform. This allowed users to select and book these definitions without the required landing zone, contrary to their intended use. This issue has been fixed.

### Lenient parsing of OpenStack catalogs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When configuring OpenStack, operators have a lot of freedom to configure catalog entries.
We fixed an error where meshStack failed to parse catalogs containing unexpected "interface"
values for a catalog entry.

### Improved Tags Layouts with Hover-Activated Overflow
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we've resolved container overflow issues caused by long tag values. Now, our application 
displays approximately three tag values visibly, with the remaining tags shown when hovered over. This 
enhancement ensures improved readability and user experience, addressing concerns about disrupted layouts 
and extended content beyond screen boundaries.

### Define Policies from Workspace to Landing Zone
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now also possible to define a Policy from Workspace to Landing Zone. A good example for 
such a policy is e.g. a policy for a matching Business Unit on your Workspaces and Landing Zones.
That way, you can restrict certain Landing Zones to only Workspaces that belong to a certain Business Unit.

### Better replication remarks for users without an EUID
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Users whose EUID is missing, can not be added to a platform tenant. But previously
the error replication remark was not consistent and on rare occasions could be missing. 
This has been fixed.

### Manage your API Keys from within your workspace
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
API Keys for their own workspace can now be managed by Workspace Owners and Workspace Managers.
Navigate to the 'API Keys' sub tab within the 'Workspace Access' tab on the Workspace Control Plane to do so.

### Manage projects with API Keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now use your API Keys to manage (create, update, delete) projects
within your workspace. More objects will be supported soon.

### Reset Platform Quota Definitions
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When configuring a platform instance that supports Quota management, operators can now
reset the platform quota definitions to meshStack built-in defaults. This allows 
operators making changes to quota definitions that to quickly return to working defaults
that are verified to be compatible with target cloud platforms.
This feature is currently available for OpenStack and Cloud Foundry platforms.

### Cloud function url restriction reduced
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The restriction of the url for cloud functions is no longer too restrictive. 
I.e. you can store any url as long as it starts with https.

### Visible warning if admin is editing notification users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
As an admin when editing the notification users of a Building Block Definition that belongs to a workspace,
you will now see a visible warning explaining that only users of that workspace can be assigned.
This will prevent any confusion around which users you can assign as notification users.

### Building Block Input Default Value
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Platform engineers can now provide default values for Building Block inputs, eliminating the need for users to manually fill out every field. Users 
retain the flexibility to override defaults as needed. When importing variables from Terraform, meshStack 
automatically populates the default value field, reducing configuration effort. Application Teams using your
Building Blocks will have an easier experience configuring those Building Blocks.

### Prevent invalid Regex for Building Block input validation
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A validation pattern for Building Block inputs must not start or end with a slash.
The validation on the form field in the admin area was improved to prevent such inputs.

### Add tags to your Building Block Definition
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have added support for tags on Building Block Definitions. You can now create and manage tags for Building Block 
Definitions in the Admin Area under Organization > Tags > Building Block Definitions. Once you set up your tags, 
anyone who creates or updates a Building Block Definition can enter those tags. Please note that the tags are on 
the definition-level, not the actual Building Blocks that live within tenants!

### Introduction of Event Logs 2.0
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You now have the new Event Logs page under the Compliance section in the 
Admin Area. This page provides an overview of user and admin activities 
in meshStack by consolidating them into a single view. With this release, 
we've introduced Workspace Event Logs, laying the foundation for even 
more event logs in the future. Stay tuned as we continue to expand logs 
related to actions in Workspace, Project, Platform, and Landing Zone 
into this page.

### Fix OSB Service Instance updates for non-updateable plans
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that ignored the non-updatable flag for service plans 
while updating a Service Instance. Such an update query did usually fail 
and displayed an unnecessary error message to the user.

### Platform Tenant ID validation for Building Block output
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When a Building Block is used for a Custom Platform to provide the Platform Tenant ID via
the assignment type, those Platform Tenant IDs are now validated and sanity checked.
A non-validating Platform Tenant ID will also make the Building Block run fail.

### Show plan details when configuring Marketplace Service
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When configuring a new service from the marketplace, the panel now shows more details
about each available plan instead of just the plan name.
This change is relevant only for services provided using an Open Service Broker.

### Fixes Subscription re-creation for Azure tenants
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
In the Azure subscription re-creation fix of the last release an edge case was missed which 
could prevent Subscription re-creation for Enterprise Agreements and Customer Agreement
based setups. This has been fixed.

### Streamlined Landing Zone Selection Process
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Our latest update simplifies the task of choosing compliant and suitable landing zones. When only one 
compliant option exists or policy constraints restrict choices, the system automatically selects the 
appropriate landing zone. This enhancement reduces manual steps and ensures teams can proceed efficiently 
while adhering to policies.

### Table filters also work with partial text
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, for many tables in the panel such as Unmanaged Tenants or Chargeback Statements you could only filter for
an exact match. For example, if you wanted to find workspace "my-first-workspace" using "first",
it would not work, but only with "my-first". We now improved the filtering system to allow for any piece of text to match,
so in the given example you could use all "my", "first" or "workspace", or even "first-workspace".

### Improved consistency of replication logs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Replication logs shown in the tenant details view of the admin have been improved.
meshStack now consistently includes basic information like HTTP method, URL,
response status code and an excerpt of the received response body for every failed
request. This information is intended to help operators debug and resolve replication
or platform configuration errors more easily.

### Landing Zone Contributors for private platforms
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now also define Landing Zone Contributors in the Admin Area for private platforms owned by workspaces. 
The selected contributing workspaces will also get access to the private platform in the marketplace to 
test their Landing Zones.

### Edit Platform Types
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Admins are now able to edit Platform Type details such as the name or logo.

### Workspace-scoped API Keys
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We introduce API Keys on a workspace level that can now be managed from inside meshPanel.
API Keys can be used to access meshStack's API in the context of one workspace only.
Individual rights can be defined for each API Key to provide a fine-grained access for different keys.

#### How to use
There is a new menu item in the Admin area called "API Keys".
To add an API Key, click on the button 'Create API Key'. After filling in all 
fields, you will see a new secret, which you can use to perform your requests. This secret is shown to
you only once, so please make sure to store it safely. For editing an API Keys, click on the 
Edit button on the right.  

With API Keys you can call the /api/login endpoint to retrieve an Bearer Token. This token needs to be
specified in further API requests within the "Authorization" header.
The /api/login endpoint expects the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content type. 
The required values are in the form of "client_id=<API KEY UUID>&client_secret=<SECRET>&grant_type=client_credentials"

### Improved Azure Provisioning Configuration
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We improved the configuration screen for Azure platforms in meshPanel.
The instructions and labels shown when configuring Microsoft Customer Agreement provisioning
are now more clear and provide additional helpful links to relevant documentation.

### Azure tenant deletion failure for disabled Subscriptions
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This fixes a rare bug that triggers if a Subscription was deleted in Azure 
but the meshTenant was not yet marked as deleted and an Owner role needed to 
be assigned according to the platform configuration. Under those circumstances,
the tenant replication and thus deletion failed.

### Single Select Drop-Down Input for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release we introduce a streamlined selection process with the "Single Select" input type for 
Building Blocks. Admins can customize selectable values, while users benefit from a simplified selection interface.

### Landing Zone Contributors
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
If you have dedicated teams providing specific Landing Zones for your platform, you can now define
their workspaces as Landing Zone Contributors on your platform. This can be used to e.g. allow
different brands of a company to provide their individual Landing Zones for a central company platform.
The Landing Zone contributors can see the platforms they are assigned to in their "Service Management Area", if
the "Service Management Area" is activated in your meshStack. They can only add and maintain their own
Landing Zones for that platform. Landing Zones contributed by other workspaces are not accessible for them. The
platform operators instead have access to all Landing Zones of their platform.

### Automated Tenant Deletion
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
This release of meshStack adds support for automated tenant deletion.
Platform operators can enable automated tenant deletion and customize the process per landing zone.

#### How to use
The deletion process in meshStack now explicitly separates approval and verification of a tenant deletion.
For tenants entering the tenant deletion queue, operators can now enable automated approval and 
automated deletion on the landing zone level. When automated deletion is enabled, the replicator
will actively delete the tenant in the cloud platform. 

To enable automated tenant deletion, the replicator requires additional permissions in your cloud platform.
For configuration instructions and additional details, please refer to our documentation.

### Fix Subscription recreation for Azure
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
If you created an Azure Subscription via meshStack, deleted the project it belonged to and then created the same
project and tenant again, no new Subscription was created. Instead, meshStack picked up the previously deleted
Subscription, which still existed in Azure for the deletion grace period in a disabled state. This issue is fixed 
now and a new Subscription is created as intended.

### Prevent platform deletion with existing Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When deleting a platform, it is now being checked, that no Building Blocks for this platform exist anymore.
Previously deletion was possible, but Building Blocks were not deletable afterwards. With this check we also
raise the awareness, that there are still active Building Blocks, that should be cleaned up by the Platform
Operator first. This can be done easily by selecting all affected Building Blocks in the Building Block Overview
and purging them.

### Fix Delayed Permission Update for SCIM
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, SCIM group membership updates caused delays in updating user permissions in meshStack, resulting in new members lacking timely access to Workspaces and Projects. This issue has now been resolved.

### Fix Workspace Role Expiration Date
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When creating a Workspace and assigning users, it was possible to remove the expiration date for the Workspace 
role with a mandatory expiration date. This issue has been fixed now.

### Fixes tenant details view for pending deletions
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes the issue that a tenant who is in a pending deletion process could
did not properly display its details view in the Admin Area.

### Payment Method Enforcement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, projects couldn't add services from the marketplace without active payment methods. Now, 
our update allows to add services regardless of payment method status. Even if payment methods expire, 
users can seamlessly manage and enhance project services, ensuring uninterrupted workflow and smoother 
project management pending when a new payment method is added.

### Workload Identity Federation for AWS platforms
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now configure Workload Identity Federation for the access configuration of AWS replicator and metering 
platform configurations. This feature enables automatic rolling of credentials and you don't have to enter 
any AWS platform credentials to meshStack anymore.

#### How to use
You can test it out by switching from the "Credentials" authentication type to "Workload Identity Federation" for all
access configurations you want to change the authentication type for (replicator and metering use separate access configurations).
You can find a description of what needs to be configured in meshPanel, when you select "Workload Identity Federation".

### View all Platform Types
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Admin Area users can now view a list of all platform types and add new platform types. In a future release this is also where you will be able to edit and remove platform types.

### Improved whitespace handling for Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When creating or editing a Building Block Definition, leading and trailing whitespaces are now cut off 
automatically by meshStack. This prevents copy-and-paste issues, which can easily contain leading or 
trailing whitespaces.

### Fix error upon platform creation
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, if your environment would have the Service Management Area disabled and you try to create a platform in the Admin Area, you would encounter an error which would also disappear after a few seconds. This error has been fixed and also now shows indefinitely.

### Fix opening Platform Usage report details page
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
In a case where TenatnID contains a slash, Platform Usage report details are not opened. This has been fixed now.

### Fix Services not showing for Shared Marketplaces
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, certain OSB Services that were restricted to specific Workspaces
were not appearing on the Marketplace of these dedicated Workspaces. This is
now fixed.

### Improve Robustness for Kubernetes/Openshift Metering
**Audience:** Operator, Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, metering did not work when the resource included a resource limit
with the k suffix, for example, a CPU limit of 1k. This resulted in empty
Tenant Usage Reports and incomplete chargeback statements. This is now fixed.
Chargeback statements will have to be regenerated. We will reach out to you if
you are impacted.

### Workload Identity Federation for GCP platforms
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now configure Workload Identity Federation for the service account in GCP replicator and metering 
platform configurations. This feature enables automatic rolling of credentials and you don't have to enter 
any GCP platform credentials to meshStack anymore.

#### How to use
You can test it out by switching from the "Credentials" authentication type to "Workload Identity Federation" for all
Service Accounts you want to change the authentication type for (e.g. replicator and metering are separate service principals).
You can find a description of what needs to be configured on the Service Account in meshPanel, when you select "Workload Identity Federation".

### Fix "View More" in the Tenants Overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you opened the overview of the tenants under "Platforms" in the sidebar and clicked on "View more" to see the details of a tenant, you encountered a navigation error. This has been fixed.

### Missing managing buttons in overview of Service Instances
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In rare cases, the buttons to update or delete a service instance didn't appear in the overview of service instances, which you could access via the marketplace control plane under Overview > Services > Service Instances. This has been fixed.

### Fix Metering of Building Blocks in Custom Platforms
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
For Building Block definitions that support more than one custom platform,
metering and cost collection was active only for one of the supported custom
platforms. Inside all other custom platforms, the Building Blocks could be
used free of charge. This is now fixed.

### UX improvement for platform and building block prices
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The section inside the panel for setting prices for platforms and building
blocks was slightly modified to improve the general user experience.

### Deprecated Onboarding Checklist
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have deprecated the onboarding checklist due to the 
incorporation of additional guidance mechanisms. Furthermore, 
for users encountering empty Workspaces, we now seamlessly
redirect them to the Marketplace tab, providing an intuitive 
avenue to explore available options to start their journey 
with meshStack.

### Deprecated OSB Services Section within Tenant
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
As previously communicated, the outdated method of adding OSB Services, 
specifically via the OSB Services section within the OSB Services Tenant, 
has been deprecated. To add Service Instances, you can now navigate to 
the Marketplace within the tenant interface. Alternatively, you can access 
the "Add Service Instances" option directly on the Instances page, which 
will conveniently redirect users to the Marketplace tab for streamlined 
service addition.

### Fix Instance Count in Building Block Reports
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
(Please note that this is only relevant for environments where the Service
Management Area is activated. This allows you to manage Platform Services from a
Workspace. Reach out to [support@meshcloud.io](mailto:support@meshcloud.io) to
have it activated in your environment.)
The financial reports for Building Blocks in the Service Management Area have
sometimes shown an incorrect number of booked instances. This is now fixed.

### Improved Visibility of Groups and Users in Search
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
An issue of searched groups or users not appearing in search suggestions during access and role assignments 
if too many search results existed has been resolved in this release. Exact matches of users, e.g. when 
searching for exact first and last name of a user or an exact group name, are shown first in the result 
list. Additionally 10 instead of only 5 users are shown in the list.

### Fix Marketplace for Workspace Members
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we've addressed an issue where workspace members were previously unable to add building blocks and 
OSB services to existing tenants. This is fixed now. Workspace members now have the capability to add platform services 
and building blocks directly from the marketplace at the tenant control plane. Please note that Workspace Members only 
have access to the Marketplace inside Tenant and not to Workspace Marketplace, as they are restricted from adding 
platforms based on their role description.

### Removed Donut Charts for OSB Services Tenants
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've enhanced the project overview by eliminating donut charts displaying
service instances and bindings for OSB Service tenants, ensuring visual
consistency. Furthermore, we've deprecated the identical donut chart within
the tenant overview to prevent information duplication since you can
conveniently access the aggregated instance data on the "Instances" page of your OSB Service tenant.

### Azure Portal page no longer shows AAD Tenant ID
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The pages with sign in instructions for Azure Portal no longer shows the AAD Tenant ID.
Cloud foundation teams operating multiple Azure Platforms with meshStack are advised to use platform instance
names to convey meaningful information to application teams.

### Provide your platforms from Service Management Area
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
(Please note that this is only relevant for environments where the Service Management Area is activated. The Service Management Area is currently in beta. This allows
you to manage Platform Services from a Workspace. Reach out to support@meshcloud.io to have it activated in your environment.)
You can now submit your platforms for publishing in the Service Management Area. This allows your platform to become accessible
to all workspaces within the organization upon approval by your cloud foundation team.

#### How to use
As a workspace manager, you can submit your platform for publishing by navigating to its control plane in the "Service
Management Area" and click on the "Submit for publishing" button. If your publication request gets rejected, you can easily 
identify the reason by hovering over the rejected label or checking the rejection comment in the history.

As a cloud foundation team member, you can review all services offered by the
workspaces. To review a service, go to "Workspaces Services" under
"Marketplace" on the left side bar. The "Workspace Services" provides you an
overview of all services which are submitted for publishing. Upon selecting a
service, you will be directed to its control plane. From there, you can either
reject the publication request or approve it, making the service accessible to
all workspaces within your organization.

### Workload Identity Federation for Azure platforms
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now configure Workload Identity Federation for the service principal in Azure replicator and metering 
platform configurations. This applies to Azure, AKS and Azure Resource Group platforms. This feature enables
automatic rolling of credentials and you don't have to enter any Azure platform credentials to meshStack anymore.

#### How to use
You can test it out by switching from the "Credentials" authentication type to "Workload Identity Federation" for all
Service Principals you want to change the authentication type for (e.g. replicator and kraken are separate service principals).
You can find a description of what needs to be configured on the Service Principal in meshPanel, when you select "Workload Identity Federation".
You can configure your Service Principal for both, "Credential" and "Workload Identity Federation" in Azure, so you can easily
switch back to the credentials based approach, if needed.

### Fix Azure Replication Failure with OSB Platform Integration
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When utilizing the Azure OSB Services platform integration with an Azure platform that shares the 
same service principal, tenant replication failed. This issue has now been resolved and users can 
use the same service principal.

### Improves Azure Function logging
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The tenant detail view now shows request and response headers as well
as the response body of an Azure function call to make debugging easier during
development.

### Fix of UI regression during Service Instance deployment
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A previous fix lead to a regression and the failure of updating Service Instances
which were in a deletion process. It also did not automatically show a dashboard link. 
This led to a poor user experience in the Marketplace and the issue has been fixed.

### Update Product Catalog after Renaming Building Block
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, renaming a Building Block definition did not trigger any changes
in the Price Catalog if a price for that Building Block was set, resulting in
Tenant Usage Reports that still included the old Building Block name. This is
now fixed.

### Building Blocks Marketplace Integration
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have made a change to the process of adding Building Blocks to improve the consistency of the experience. Now, 
when you click the "Add Building Block" button on the Building Blocks page within your Tenant, you will be redirected 
to the Tenant Marketplace tab. This will allow you to easily browse and select the desired Building Blocks, which 
will streamline your workflow and make the process smoother and more efficient.

### Building Block Costs in the Service Management Area
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
(Please note that this is only relevant for environments where the Service
Management Area is activated. This allows you to manage Platform Services from a
Workspace. Reach out to [support@meshcloud.io](mailto:support@meshcloud.io) to
have it activated in your environment.)
In addition to the overview of your Platform's usage in the Service Management
area, we have added a new section that provides financial reports for your
Building Blocks. This enhancement allows you to easily track the number of
bookings for your Building Blocks and provides valuable insights into your
revenue generation.

### Deleted Tenant Management in Service Management Area
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
(Please note that this is only relevant for environments where the Service Management Area is activated. This allows
you to manage Platform Services from a Workspace. Reach out to support@meshcloud.io to have it activated in your environment.)
You can now view and approve/decline tenant deletions for platforms that you own in your Service Management Area. This
works exactly like you are used to in the Admin Area, the only difference being that you only see tenants from
platforms owned by your workspace.

#### How to use
In the Service Management Area you will find the section "Deleted Tenants" under "Platforms" in the sidebar. In this
screen you will be able to view all deleted tenants and approve or decline tenants awaiting deletion confirmation.

### Fix pending replications after tenant creation
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
In some cases, a newly created tenant stayed in a pending state until the nightly replication was running.
This also included the update of the platformTenantId on the tenant itself, if you e.g. requested it via API.
The tenant was still created quickly in the background and existed in the cloud platform. It was just not updated 
in meshStack directly. The update would only be applied with the next replication that was executed. This issue 
is fixed now and newly created tenants will go into a final state as soon as the tenant was created in the platform.

### Guidance for Adding Platform Services from Marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Users will now have clear guidance when adding Platform Services 
from the Marketplace with a progress sidebar that will accompany 
you through every step and show the current state. This will 
help to make the process smoother and ensure that even new users 
will not encounter any obstacles when using meshStack.

### Fix OpenStack configuration errors stalling replications
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
If there was an OpenStack platform misconfiguration (e.g. a wrong password), this could
lead to OpenStack tenants in this platform to get stuck for up to 30 minutes until they
could replicate again. This was fixed.

### Retry Terraform Init for Building Block execution
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
In some private environments, where proxies for internet access are used, terraform init can fail
due to connectivity issues. We implemented a simple retry for terraform init to work around these
temporary connectivity issues.

### Fix editing of Platform Notifications
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Due to a recent regression, it was not possible to edit Platform Notifications anymore.
This is fixed now.

### Auto-Refresh pending OSB service instances
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A new pending status was introduced for OSB Service Instances previously. Those Service Instances were not
refreshed automatically in meshPanel, which resulted in the user having to click refresh on his own.
This is fixed now and those service instances are also refreshed automatically, like service instances
that are in an "in progress" state.

### Fix Azure Cost Data
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
From the beginning of March 2024, Azure's Cost Management API supplied an incorrect cost item, which duplicated the 
total subscription cost and as a result, affected Tenant Usage Reports showed duplicated costs. This fix stops processing 
these invalid cost items and cleans up previously collected data. After the fix is deployed, meshcloud will regenerate 
usage reports and Chargeback Statements for affected environments, so that you will have no duplicate cost data for February 
and March 2024.

### Enhanced Tenant Creation Process
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have enhanced the tenant creation process with a revamped
 wizard flow, making it more user-friendly and aligned with 
 the project creation process. With this update, users can 
 now navigate through the tenant creation journey with greater 
 ease and confidence, drawing upon their familiarity with the 
 project creation flow to add tenants effortlessly.

### Financial Control in the Service Management Area
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
(Please note that this is only relevant for environments where the Service
Management Area is activated. This allows you to manage Platform Services from
a Workspace. Reach out to support@meshcloud.io to have it activated in your
environment.)
With this change, you will gain a comprehensive overview of your
Platform's usage, including the prices you've charged to users and their
associated usage costs from providers to be able to identify anomalies.
Accessible through a newly introduced Financial page within the Service
Management Area, this overview includes all usage reports from all tenants
across various Workspaces dedicated to your Platforms. Please stay tuned for
the upcoming financial overview for Building Blocks, which will be available
soon as well.

### Add Service Instance Button
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
A new "Add Service Instance" button has been added to the OSB Marketplace Instance screen 
to make it easier for users to add Service Instances, ensuring a consistent and smoother 
Marketplace workflow.

### Transfer Platform Service Ownership to Workspaces
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
(Please note that this is only relevant for environments where the Service Management Area is activated. This allows
you to manage Platform Services from a Workspace. Reach out to support@meshcloud.io to have it activated in your environment.)
The owning Workspace (or Admin Area) can now be changed for Platforms & Building Block Definitions. This means you can
transfer the ownership of either of these to a single Workspace, or even back to the Admin Area if needed. The publication
status of the Service will remain, meaning that if a Platform was already publicly available, it will remain publicly available after transfer.

#### How to use
On either the Platform Control Plane or Building Block Definition Control Plane, navigate to the Danger Zone. In this
screen you will find a section called "Transfer Ownership" where you can select a different Workspace (or the Admin
Area) to be the new owner of the Service.

### Fix "not found" message for private OSB marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When you open an OSB marketplace tenant owned by that workspace, you sometimes face an error message stating that it could not be found. This has been fixed.

### Improve Chargeback Generation Resiliency
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The generation of Chargeback statements was improved to resiliently consider
some edge cases. In particular, we have observed issues during Chargeback
Generation when many custom platforms had been used or if Tenant Usage Reports
for many months have been re-generated. This is now fixed.

### Fix the Display of Errors During Platform Creation
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, when creating a new Platform or Building Block definition, you might encounter 
a validation error at the last stage, which was not displayed without reason and message.
This issue has been fixed, and now you will see an error message with the exact details.

### Apply updated user permissions directly to Building Blocks
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
If a Building Block uses a "User Permissions" input, these permissions are now directly
updated when permissions on the project change. Before that change, it was only updated
when a tenant replication succeeded.
Additionally, permissions and other automatically determined inputs are now updated to the latest
state when a new Building Block run is executed.

### Service Brokers in Service Management Area
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If the Service Management Area is enabled in your environment, you can now also manage Service Brokers
in this area and it is no longer available in the Workspace Control Plane. If you don't have the Service Management
Area enabled, Service Brokers can still be managed the same way as before.

### Project Creation Improvement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have improved the overall project creation process to 
offer a streamlined and user-friendly experience. You are 
no longer overwhelmed with the list of all available 
Building Blocks for the Platform you have chosen. Now, 
only the mandatory Building Blocks will be shown for 
configuration. You can easily check out other Building 
Blocks on the Marketplace Catalog whenever you want.

### Service instance created under previously selected workspace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In rare cases, service instances were created under the previously selected workspace when you ordered them on the marketplace control plane under Overview > OSB Services. This has been fixed.

### Mandatory Building Blocks not shown in dependency selection
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you created a Tenant with a Landing Zone having mandatory Building Blocks and dependencies, these pre-selected mandatory Building Blocks did not appear in the dependency selection. This has been fixed.

### Add "Restricted" badge for Platform Instances
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
In the Service Management Area and  in the Admin Area, a new state 
"Restricted" for Platform Instances was introduced. This makes it 
clear in what mode a Platform Instance is setup. Private means the 
Instance is only usable by a single workspace. "Restricted" means 
the Instance is usable by multiple Workspaces. A "Public" Instance 
is usable by everyone.

### Fix meshfed API ResourceUsageReports
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, adding a ResourceUsageReport via the meshfed API could result in
environmental TURPs including line items from that ResourceUsageReport. This
is now fixed. Only customers who are using GCP and have created
ResourceUsageReports in the past are impacted.

### Update Cloud Foundry and OpenStack tenant control planes
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
The Cloud Foundry and OpenStack tenant control plane dashboards now include
Horizon (OpenStack), Cloud Foundry console and CLI instructions directly on the dashboard.

#### How to use
With this change we have also removed any features that allowed interacting
with OpenStack and Cloud Foundry resources directly from meshPanel. Use of these features
was only possible when these platforms were integrated with the deprecated (and meanwhile removed)
"meshStack provisioned identities" IAM architecture.

### Quota Management for OpenStack and Cloud Foundry
**Audience:** Customer, Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
Quotas for OpenStack and Cloud Foundry can now be managed the same way Kubernetes and OpenShift
quotas are managed. This includes defining the quotas you would like to have on your platform,
setting reasonable defaults for the quotas on different Landing Zones and workspace managers being
able to simply request the quotas they want via meshPanel.

### Landing Zones for OpenStack and Cloud Foundry
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now define Landing Zones for OpenStack and Cloud Foundry. This allows you to use meshPolicies
and define mandatory Building Blocks also for these private cloud platforms.

### Cloud Foundry configuration available in self-service
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Platform Operators can now modify the platform configuration for Cloud Foundry platforms
on their own via the Platform Control Plane.

### Aligned Project and Tenant deletion experience
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The user experiences for confirming project and tenant deletion have been aligned and simplified.
Tenants of all platform types will now always enter the deletion queue, thereby making the workflow more consistent and predictable.
Any future automation of tenant deletion will be based around the queue and configurable by operators.

#### How to use
Both project and tenant deletion experiences will now list all relevant consequences of deletion in the first step of the process.
meshPanel will no longer ask to type in an identifier for confirmation, but instead presents a simple "are you sure" prompt as the final step.
We have also removed the "resource check" step from the tenant and project deletion workflow, which offered a review of cloud resources that prevent tenant deletion.
This additional step was only supported for OSB, OpenStack and Cloud Foundry tenants and allowed bypassing the deletion queue for this tenant.
meshStack continues to validate that a tenant has no attached building blocks or service instances before allowing a workspace user to delete the tenant.

### Fixed Broken Login
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, some users experienced issues logging in and 
found themselves in a state where both login and logout 
functions were not working as expected. This was particularly 
problematic for new users attempting to access meshStack for 
the first time. This is now fixed.

### Create an Empty Project
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now create an empty Project without any Platform Service. 
This makes Project creation easier and more flexible, allowing 
you to import tenants afterward efficiently without constraints.

### Don't apply discounts on environmental reports
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
Discounts (or fees), that are applied on usage reports, can be defined in meshStack. If they are
only scoped to a certain sellerId, they were also applied on environmental reports. This is fixed now
and the discounts won't be applied to environmental reports anymore.

### Tenant replication accidentally reported as failed
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
Under rare conditions (often happening when using a custom platform), a previously successful replication
of a tenant was shortly after reported as failed. This was only a display error and has been fixed.

### OpenStack configuration available in self-service
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Platform Operators can now modify the platform configuration for OpenStack platforms
on their own in the Admin Area.

### Payment Identifier special character regression
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
A recent fix, which fixed payment identifier validation to only allow alphanumeric and
dash characters, affected some meshStacks in a negative way. This relaxes the validation again to
fix the workflow for those affected meshStacks.

### Enable Metering by Default for Platform Services
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
This change enables to setting prices for Platforms and Building Blocks without additional metering 
configuration via pre-configured optimal parameters in the integration configuration metering section.

### Fix Building Block notification users within workspaces
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
In the new Services Management Area, which is only available at the moment if you requested it for your environment,
you were not able to add notification users to Building Blocks. This is fixed now and you can add users that are assigned
to your workspace.

### Performance Improvement for meshObject API
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, reading users via the meshObject API was very slow when the filter included
both Workspace and Project parameters. This has been improved now.

### Remove Service User feature for OpenStack and Cloud Foundry
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
This release removes the Service Users feature that was supported for OpenStack and Cloud Foundry platforms.
Building Blocks provide a better way to implement these capabilities.
Service Users are "technical users" that authenticate with username and passwords in these platforms.
A popular use case for these "technical users" was to enable CI/CD pipelines to deploy against managed cloud tenants.

#### How to use
We recommend that operators that want to enable technical users for OpenStack and Cloud Foundry implement this capability
as building blocks via meshStack or via their federated IdP integration (e.g. technical users in LDAP).
Both options provide operators with more control over credential handling and rotation workflows.

### Improved login renewal
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the past, your login session could expire and you were
redirected to a retry page. The login renewal and retry behavior 
have been improved.

### Fix input encryption for Building Block upgrades
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, sensitive Building Block inputs have not been encrypted properly
during the Building Block upgrade process. This is fixed now.
Furthermore, encryption is now only possible for input fields that are provided
statically, by user input or by platform operator input. Other fields, like e.g.
the workspace identifier or project identifier are known to meshStack anyway and
thus cannot be seen as secrets.

### Fix Azure Geo-Replication Cost
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, meshStack did not process Geo-Replication bandwidth costs for
Azure correctly, which could result in the reported costs being lower than
actual. We will reach out to every customer impacted by this to elaborate on
this issue.

### Fix payment methods with special characters in identifier
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A bug allowed the creation of payment methods with special characters as
the identifier which later could not be properly be displayed. Both issues
have been fixed.

### List owner workspaces for platforms in admin area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The workspace identifier that owns a platform instance is now displayed in the Admin Area. You can also
use it to search for specific platform instances.

### Service instances invisible when added by meshObject API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
If a workspace had no matching Marketplace tenant, the added service instances via
the meshObject API were not directly visible. 
This fix automatically creates this missing tenant to make service 
instances directly visible.

### Set Pricing for Platform Services in meshStack
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Now in meshStack, you have the flexibility to define prices for Platform Services, such as Building Blocks 
and Platforms in addition to usage costs from providers. Configuring your internal prices allows you to account 
for various expenses such as licensing costs or the effort invested in maintaining and enhancing Platform Services.
These internal prices will be displayed on the service details page within the Marketplace.

#### How to use
For Platforms, you can now establish monthly or daily recurring fees per meshTenant, which will be charged only 
once when a user adds a Platform Tenant. You can configure prices within meshStack by navigating to the Pricing tab 
of the Platform Settings. For Building Blocks monthly and daily recurring fees per Building Block instance could be 
configured by navigating to the Pricing tab of the Building Block definition setting.

### Fix resetting of Building Block Operator Input
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
Building Block Operator inputs were reset, if tenant replication succeeded for the related tenant. 
This is fixed now and the operator inputs remain untouched on the Building Block after tenant
replication.

### Fix for deletion of WorkspaceUserGroups
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When a WorkspaceUserGroup was deleted, permissions on the according workspace
were removed for all users and groups. As WorkspaceUserGroup deletion is only
possible via API and is usually done via an automated sync process, those
permissions were recreated again on the next synchronization run. So it was
only a temporary issue. It is fixed now, so only the permissions for the
deleted WorkspaceUserGroup are removed from the workspace.

### Fix showing Building Block Runs if waiting for operator
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
If a Building Block was in the "Waiting For Operator" status, no Runs were shown for this
Building Block. This is fixed now.

### Platform and Building Block management for workspaces
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to define Building Blocks and Platforms from within a workspace. As this feature is in Beta,
it is only available in QA environments by default. If you want to enable this Beta feature in your environment,
please contact "support@meshcloud.io". Building Blocks and Platforms created within a workspace are currently only
available within the same workspace (publishing them will be available soon). This feature enables you to build up
a service ecosystem to which everyone in your organization can contribute. It also provides clear responsibility
for operating Building Blocks and Platforms, as they are owned by a certain workspace with a defined list of workspace
members and an owner.

#### How to use
If configured as mentioned above, you now find a "Go To Services Management" button in the Workspace Control Plane.
Via that button you get to the area, where you can manage your Building Blocks and Platforms.

### Prevent Azure Subscription re-discovery in legacy process
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the legacy Azure Enterprise Agreement enrollment Subscription creation process
an existing Subscription that was waiting for deletion could be accidentally
recognized as an existing tenant in meshStack, preventing a successful replication. This rare case has been
fixed.

### Fix dead links in API documentation
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, the links for the Postman collection and the OpenAPI documentation
in our public API docs did not work. This is now fixed.

### Generate building block definition outputs from terraform
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now import outputs by copy-pasting terraform code into the meshStack panel.

### Sort name & identifier in workspace overview
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to sort on the name & identifier of a workspace in the workspace overview in the Admin Area.
This should make it easier to get an overview of all workspaces under your management.

### Extending Information in Service Catalog
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've added additional information to distinguish the offered 
services in the marketplace. Labels below the title of the offering 
will inform you about typ, location or privacy making it easier to 
find what users are looking for

### Fixed login for newly created users
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, in some cases, a newly created user was unable to log in and could indefinitely 
see a welcome page. This has now been fixed.

### Fix handling of Building Block logs with special characters
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In rare cases, handling Building Block logs with some special characters failed. This lead to the Building Block being shown as "In Progress", even though it was executed successfully. This is fixed now.

### Fix of AWS Control Tower enrollment replication failures
**Audience:** Partner, User<br>

#### Description
If the initial AWS Control Tower enrollment for an Account failed the 
replication process was unable to recover and got stuck. This has been fixed.

### Fix user permissions input during Building Block upgrade
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When adding a user permissions input to a Building Block Definition in a new version,
upgrading existing Building Blocks was not possible. This is fixed now.

### Improved Deletion handling of Building Blocks
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
If deletion of a Building Block failed, it was not possible to click the "Delete" button again on the Building Block.
You only had the option to execute the run to trigger the deletion again. The "Delete" button is now also available in
those cases. Additionally it is no longer possible to delete a Building Block, if it is being processed at the moment, 
as this can lead to inconsistent states.

### Bug fixes & renaming of Importing Unmanaged Tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A bug was fixed where an unmanaged tenant could not be imported when the Partner Admin was not assigned to the workspace. From now on, a Partner Admin can import and unmanaged tenant regardless of whether they are assigned to the workspace. Another UI bug was fixed where selecting another workspace would not reset the project selection. Lastly, the functionality has been renamed in the UI to 'Assign Tenant to Project'.

### Tooltip with exact date, when "time ago" ago is shown
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Whenever meshStack shows that something was done a certain time ago, you can now hover of this
text to see the exact date in a tooltip. This can help in some cases, like if want to find
out if one Building Block Run was executed before another.

### Remove Cloud Foundry Private Domain Management Feature
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
Workspace owners could previously register Cloud Foundry "Private Domains" from their Workspace settings.
meshStack would replicate these domain assignments into any connected Cloud Foundry platforms.
This feature has been removed from meshStack, in favor of supporting this use case via building blocks.

### Fix initially failed Terraform Building Block deletion
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
If the deletion of a Building Block failed during tf-destroy, the terraform workspace, that kept the terraform state
was deleted. Therefore the next run for the deletion succeeded, but did not delete any resources,
as it did not find any state anymore. This is fixed now and the terraform state now remains until tf-destroy
was executed successfully.

### Fix permissions for operating OSB Service Instances
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
In some cases, as an OSB operator, you encountered an issue that you were not allowed 
to purge service instances or access logs of service instances for services that you own 
in your workspace. This has now been fixed.

### Prevent Unnecessary Notifications for Deleted Users
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Due to an issue in the user deletion process, changes were not propagated to the notification system. This resulted in notifications being sent to deleted users.

### Improved Terraform init log details
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When a Terraform Building Block is executed and "terraform init" fails, we now provide more details about the
error in the remarks of the Building Block Run.

### Allows import of different users sharing an email address
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This fixes a meshObject API user import issue that was triggered if multiple 
users shared the same email address (e.g. an admin and a normal user account 
of the same person).

### Improvements to Building Block run resilience
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Depending on the Building Block setup and the resulting run dependency setup it could 
happen that due to race conditions the status updates were processed incorrectly. This
lead to seemingly stuck Building Block runs. An additional
bug prevented the automatic timeout of those "stuck" runs. Both issues are fixed.

### Improved Publishing Concept for Building Blocks
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
As we are currently introducing the management of Building Block Definitions for workspaces, it will
soon be possible to publish those Building Block Definitions, so they are available to all workspaces
via the marketplace. As this publishing conflicts with the current "publish Building Block Definition version",
we decided to rename it to "release Building Block Definition version", because you will just provide a new
release of an already published definition.

### Show who owns a Building Block Definition to Admins
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The Building Block Definition list in the Admin Area now contains a sortable and filterable column for
"Owned By Workspace". That way, admins can easily get an overview of which workspace offers which
Building Block Definitions.

### Make status of Building Block Definitions visible
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Currently Building Block Definitions can either be in a draft state, when they were only created with a draft
version in a workspace, or they are in a published state. These states are now shown when listing or showing
a Building Block Definition. It is also possible to filter on this state in the Building Block Definition list.
In the marketplace the draft state of a Building Block Definition is now also indicated with an according badge.
It helps workspace members to identify Building Block Definitions that are only available inside their workspace
as a draft and not available to any other workspaces.

### Marketplace Improvements
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've implemented several enhancements to the Marketplace, 
including the addition of tooltips on the service details 
screen and related to dependent BB selection.

### Quota Request notification
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Upon the submission of a new quota request, a notification can now be sent. Notifications are directed to a dedicated email address. Please reach out if you want us to send out notifications around quota requests.

### Azure Subscription Owners are added during Tenant Deletion
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Azure Subscriptions require at least one Owner. During Tenant deletion the additional Subscription Owner IDs from the Azure Platform Configuration were not considered. This could lead to stuck Azure Tenant deletions if the platform configuration was changed while a Tenant was already in the deletion process. This has been fixed.

### Renaming of Marketplace to OSB Services
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this change, we renamed "Marketplace" to "OSB Services" 
left navigation page inside the Tenant Overview.

### Allow Minus Sign for Importing Resource Usage Reports
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description

### Next Generation Marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Exciting announcement! The all-new Marketplace of the 
next generation is officially live. We are thrilled 
to share that this upgrade provides you with a transparent 
overview of your cloud portfolio, making it easier for 
teams to access services and platforms for projects. 
To explore the Marketplace, simply go to the dedicated 
tab on your Workspace panel.

#### How to use
For detailed information on the Marketplace, please 
check the accompanying documentation under the meshMarketplace 
section of the User Docs. For a step-by-step guide on adding 
Building Blocks, Platform, and OSB Services, please refer 
to the "How to Add Platform Service from the Marketplace 
Catalog" page in the Guide section of the User Docs.

### Fix handling of OSB errors
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
With release 2024.2.0 a regression was introduced, that led to service instances and service bindings of an OSB service
instance being stuck in pending state, if the service Broker returned an error. Additionally the call to the service broker was
executed again every second, which led to a lot of service communication logs being created. These issues are fixed now.

#### How to use
The fix for affected service instances, that are stuck in pending state will be applied asynchronously after the release.
These service instances will be transitioned into a failed state with the error message, the service broker provided. It can
take up to a few days until these service instances are fixed.

### Fix Building Block Card Link
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you clicked on the name of a Building Block on the Tenant control plane in the Admin Area, you were redirected to a "Not found" page. The broken redirection has been fixed now.

### SCIM support must be enabled in the settings
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously you were only able to optionally force user management via SCIM through
the flag "SCIM only user management" in the Admin Area Settings section. 
If this flag was not set, user invitations via IDPs like Entra ID or Google Cloud Directory
worked parallel to SCIM, which could lead to user sync issues.
This flag is now mandatory if you want to use SCIM user management. It will allow to only assign users
in meshStack which previously were imported via SCIM.

### Fix purging of draft Building Blocks with dependencies
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
When you were using a draft Building Block Definition in your own workspace and added
a new dependency to your Definition after already creating a Building Block for it, it
was no longer possible to purge the Building Block. This is fixed now and purging of the
Building Block succeeds.

#### How to use
If you have multiple Building Blocks of that Definition in place before adding a new dependency,
you have to bulk purge all of the affected Building Blocks at once.

### Fix Building Blocks fullPlatformIdentifier input
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We found and fixed a bug where the Tenant Identifier was used as
input value for Building Block inputs that have the Full Platform Identifier
specified as Input Source. This is now fixed. All affected Building Blocks 
need to be run again to update to the correct value.

### Information about Missing Payment Methods
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, the absence of a payment method in your workspace was only apparent when you were in the 
midst of creating a project. Now, we provide a clearer information within your workspace control panel, 
if no payment method is configured.

### Fix Search Results for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Whenever a search for Building Blocks or their definition provided no matching result meshStack showed a wrong message. This has now been fixed and meshStack differentiates between no Building Blocks available or no matching search result found.

### Fix of wrong status display on dependent Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug which could have triggered a wrong status update on dependent 
Building Blocks that belong to a definition, which was added multiple times on the same tenant. 
They were displayed as "waiting for dependency" even though they already 
successfully ran.

### Fix for encrypted Building Block inputs
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
There was a bug that would encrypt Building Block input multiple times
in cases where a Building Block definition had encryption enabled for both,
User Input sources and Platform Operator Input sources. This has been fixed
now. However, Building Blocks that encountered this bug before this release
cannot be repaired automatically. In the instances affected by this bug
the inputs have to be provided again.

### Improve Building Block Dependency Options
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When defining dependencies on Building Block Definitions, we introduced a change with the latest release,
that all Building Block Definitions are available. They were not filtered to match the Supported Platforms
defined on the definition anymore. We revert this change for now due to some limitations of it. But for the future,
it is planned to bring this functionality back.

### Support git branches and tags in Building Blocks
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, it was possible to pin a git repository to a specific version using commit
hashes. Now it is possible to use git branches and tags.

### Fix Tenant Creation with Service Provisioning Failure
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, some input parameters for configuring an OSB when creating a new meshTenant were 
missing. This issue has been resolved now.

### Fix Access for Tenant Overview Panel
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, users with Workspace Manager or Workspace Owner role 
who were not members of a particular Project could not access 
the Overview tab, even though they could access other tabs such 
as Finance. This issue has been fixed, and now they have complete 
access to all tabs without any restrictions.

### Workspace scoped shopping cart
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Now your marketplace platform service will be scoped to your current 
workspace. We've also added a dialog to make it easier to see what 
you've selected. The advantage is that you can now decide to create 
a new project based on your service selection or an empty project.

### Resolved Flickering in Building Blocks-related Tables
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, the Building Block Definition and the Building Block tables showed an empty list info before the data loaded, causing a flickering effect. This is fixed now.

### Fix Workspace Manager Access for tenant control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, attempting to access the tenant control plane without project assignment led to a "Something's gone wrong..." page. This issue has been fixed.

### Fix redirect for custom platforms from Marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When you wanted to add a Building Block for a custom platform from the Marketplace, you ran into
a Not Found page after adding the Building Block to a specific tenant. This is fixed now. You are
now redirected to the Building Block list of the selected tenant.

### New Building Block Definitions are now in Draft state
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
New Building Block Definitions won't be published automatically after creation anymore. Instead, they will stay
in Draft state. With the new feature to manage Building Block Definitions inside workspaces, this enables
Building Block Definition creators to first test their Building Block Definition in their own workspace, as also
their own draft Building Block Definitions are available for them. This provides a much smoother Building Block
Development experience, as no new version is required for every fix or change. Please be aware, that Building Block Definitions
in draft state, created in the Admin Area, cannot be tested, as no tenants can be created in the Admin Area. Therefore the Best-Practice
approach is to create new Building Block Definitions within a dedicated workspace. But also in the Admin Area, you have to publish
new Building Block Definitions explicitly now, before they can be used inside workspaces.

### Missing workspaces when creating payment methods
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Fixes an issues where not all workspaces were selectable when creating a new payment method.

### Improved handling for SCIM group requests
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, meshStack was not able to handle a large amount of SCIM
group requests being sent in parallel. This has been improved.

### Workspace role expiration audit log entries show acting user
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Workspace audit log entries for changed role expiration events were missing the user performing the change and were showing the affected user instead.

### Fix Service Instance creation during project creation
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
If a Service Broker called the meshObject API during Service Instance provisioning,
it could happen, that e.g. the project was not yet available via the API. This issue
is fixed.

### File inputs could not be decrypted
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Fixes a problem where encrypted file inputs for Building Blocks could not be
decrypted when they were added during initial Building Block creation.

#### How to use
Existing Building Blocks that use encrypted file inputs and that currently
show an error of "illegal base64 data at input byte 4" or similar when run
can be fixed by creating a new version where any encrypted file inputs are
removed and recreated. This is only necessary when Building Block runs result
in errors and not for all Building Blocks using encrypted file inputs.

### Improves Azure Platform Configuration description
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Improves the description of the impact when skipping the Azure Subscription 
owner assignment in the platform configuration.

### Description and Links for Platforms and Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now enhance information about Platforms by providing detailed 
descriptions, which will be shown on the Marketplace Catalog. 
Additionally, you can include now support links and documentation 
for your Building Blocks and Platform, allowing users to easily access 
valuable information and ensure a transparent communication channel.

#### How to use
You can add links and descriptions during any Platform Service creation. 
For Platforms afterward in the General subtab of the Settings tab and 
for Building Block links could be added afterward in the General tab 
of the Building Block definition.

### Improve Partner Workspace Selection
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We've enhanced the user experience by introducing a caching feature 
for Partners. Now, when you log out, meshStack remembers your 
Workspace choice. Next time you log in, you'll go straight to 
your last Workspace, making things smoother and saving time.

### Multi tab improvement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When you were working for a longer time during a day in meshStack 
and e.g. were away for a while, you could have seen a 
"Something went wrong" screen. This also happened in other cases 
like an unassignment of your user from the workspace or when using 
multiple tabs with different workspaces or the Admin Area open. 
The handling around this has been improved, so you should see the 
"Something went wrong" screen with e.g. an "access denied" message 
only in cases where it is intended to see this screen (e.g. trying 
to access a project you don't have access to). Regarding the 
multi-tab handling, please keep in mind, that if you switch the 
workspace in one tab and do a page reload on another tab, where you 
had a different workspace open, you will be redirected to the 
recently selected workspace or the admin area. When switching between 
different workspaces in that case, you will also still see an 
"access denied" page, so you are aware, that you will now be 
redirected to another workspace.

### Fix static sensitive Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Static sensitive inputs were double encrypted, when the Building Block was created during tenant
creation via meshObject API. This lead to a still encrypted value being provided to Terraform.
This is fixed now and static sensitive inputs are provided as expected to Terraform.

#### How to use
Existing Building Blocks with this issue have to be recreated.

### Removal of Deprecated OpenStack Panko Support
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
In the past, meshStack supported using OpenStack Panko events for metering
purposes. OpenStack has deprecated Panko and no longer includes it in
official OpenStack releases. We have therefore decided to remove support for
it from meshStack. Customers can continue using meshStack's state-based
metering data collection for OpenStack.

### New Welcome Page
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In our ongoing commitment to enhancing the user experience, we have introduced a new welcome page that 
will appear before login. The most exciting aspect is that you can customize it to your liking! Simply 
add your logo and a personalized description under the 'Welcome Page' tab on the Settings page to warmly 
greet your users.

### SCIM Requests Rate Limit
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With this change, we've enhanced the stability of SCIM by introducing a rate
limit for the SCIM endpoints to prevent any potential out-of-memory issues.

### Fix validation not shown in Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, input regex validations of building block definitions wouldn't be displayed on the building block definition control plane if no draft version of the building block definition exists. This has been fixed.

### Fix expiration date updates of Workspace Owner
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, an error occurred when attempting to update the expiration date of Workspace Owners, stating that only 2 Workspace Owners could be assigned at the same time. This issue has now been fixed.

### Enhancement of Navigation Bar Menu
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have made various improvements to the navigation bar menu. Firstly, if you had your own support and documentation
links in the footer for Workspace users, we have moved them to the convenient 'Help' button at the top of the screen,
making it easier for application teams to find relevant information. If you wish to include this link, feel free to
get in touch with our support team. Furthermore, all other links that were previously in the footer can now
be found in the dropdown profile menu, along with some new product feedback options.
Lastly, the Admin Area button no longer shows up if you are already in the Admin Area.

### Fix bug in newly created OSB dashboard clients
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This is only relevant for Enterprise Plan: A bug was introduced where not all required scopes were included
when creating dashboard clients in meshIdB. This is now fixed for new clients.
Existing clients were fixed manually in meshIdB. If you still encounter scope issues with an existing client,
please open a support request.

### Add Audit Logs for Users Added via SCIM
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, when a user was assigned to a Workspace after being added to a
group via SCIM no audit events were generated. This issue has been addressed
and resolved.

### Make stuck Building Block runs runnable again
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In rare cases it could happen that a Building Block run remained in the
'PENDING' state. 
After 6 hours those runs are getting automatically assumed as failed and
can be triggered again in the Admin Area.

### Notification for Workspace Roles Expiration
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
In a previous release, we have introduced a change where users receive a
notification one week before their Workspace Role expires. This was now
increased from one week to two weeks, ensuring that users have sufficient time
to take action before the Workspace Role expires.

### Adding Platform Service
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With the change, you can now add any Platform Service from the Marketplace 
to existing Projects and Tenants, which offers you the flexibility to 
tailor Platform Services to your unique needs.

#### How to use
Select your desired Platform Service from the Workspace Marketplace and 
proceed by clicking "Continue". In the initial step, opt to either create 
a new Project or seamlessly integrate the chosen Platform Service into 
an existing one. Moving to the second step, you have the flexibility to 
either choose from suitable existing Tenants or establish a new Tenant 
specifically for your Platform Service.

### Admin project list did not show all payment methods
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When editing payment methods in the project list (admin area) all payment methods are now shown instead of only the first 50.

### Azure CA Subscription platform config uses additional Owner
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a regression that disabled the possibility of using additional Subscription
owner principals when using the Customer Agreement configuration.
This is important if no other replicated user group has Owner permissions as this is a requirement
of Azure and could lead to failed replications during Subscription creation.

### OSB communication log detail not visible
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Detailed communication logs for a service broker on the workspace level are accessible again, previously a page not found error was shown.

### Fix of SCIM PATCH Requests Rejection
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, if you changed a user's address or added it in Azure Entra ID,
meshStack rejected SCIM PATCH requests afterward. You can now expect seamless
processing, as the issue has been fixed.

### Tenant Control Plane Marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this update, the Marketplace is now also accessible for you in the Tenant Control Plane. This 
empowers you to opt for services like Building Blocks or OSB that are tailored specifically to your 
tenant, which will simplify your experience of adding Services to your tenant as well as provide a 
comprehensive portfolio of Service offerings for specific platforms.

#### How to use
Click on the Tenant within a Project and head over to the Marketplace tab. Here, you can choose 
your Service by configuring it first and then finalizing the process with a simple click on the 
"Add Service" button.

### Workspace financial overview chart values in wrong order

**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug which prevented the purging of Service Instances 
from private Service Broker via the recently introduced feature.

### Fix display multiple currencies in Chargeback Statements
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, the chargeback statements, which included CO2 information, displayed the net amount 
for each currency within the scope of the chargeback statement separately, without converting the currency.

### Improved performance of Usage Report generation
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Generation of Usage Reports for highly dynamic tenants where resources are created
and deleted frequently, did put a high load on the system. This has been improved
to put way less load on the system and to execute usage report generation a lot faster.

### Fixed custom platform replication issue
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We found and removed a bug that occurred during replication of
tenants from custom platforms, after a custom platform had been
deleted.

In some cases it was possible to get an error in the Cloud Foundation 
financials dashboard because the platform type could not be set correctly. 
This is now fixed.

### Fix not updating Marketplace Usage Reports
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Usage Reports for Marketplace Tenants were not updated since the Release 2023.26.0. With this release they are now updated again. This only affected the current month of December and once the new release is deployed, marketplace usage reports for December will be up to date again.

### Preselection of Global Marketplace
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change, when you create a project, the Global Marketplace won't be automatically selected 
unless most of the services in your meshStack portfolio are OSB Services.

### Increase timeouts for metering data migrations
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
meshStacks with a lot of metering data take longer to run required data migrations and may have run into timeouts during application startup.

All service instances are shown, searchable and deletable regardless of the state they are in

### Fix 'Platforms' item in menu sidebar
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We resolved an issue preventing users from adding the 'Platforms' menu item to their Favorites.

### Fix for October Usage Reports and Chargeback Statement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack version v2023.18 introduced a bug that affects Tenant Usage Reports and Chargeback Statements for 
Private Clouds, OSB Services, and Tenant as well as Landing Zone with fees for October 2023.
Specifically, if a resource in a Private Cloud or OSB Service was deleted between the 1st and 15th of October, 
the corresponding data in Tenant Usage Reports and Chargeback Statements is missing for October 2023. Similarly, 
for Platforms and Landing Zones with fee configurations, if tenants were deleted during the mentioned timeframe,
the fee data for those deleted tenants is also missing for October 2023. No other data or months are impacted.
The underlying issue is fixed now. When this release is deployed, usage reports and chargeback statements for
october and november will be regenerated. This can take up to several hours. In that timeframe usage reports and
chargeback statements for october and november can temporarily disappear in meshStack, but will appear with
correct data again after some time.

### Fix button in platform onboarding pop-up
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, clicking on the "don't show this again" button of the pop-up that
appeared after a platform was created did not have any effect. This is now
fixed.

### Disabled users are shown in Workspace and Project Access
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When a user is disabled via SCIM, their access to the project is 
revoked. Previously, this was not transparent in Workspace/Project Access, which
led to confusion. To clarify the status of disabled users, we have introduced 
a "Disabled" badge that is displayed next to the user. With this badge, it is 
now clear that the user is no longer able to access the project.

### Fix deleted tenants sometimes showing up in tenants list
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, deleted tenants sometimes appeared with a failed replication state in the list of tenants under Platforms > Tenants for a few hours. This has been fixed.

### Mandatory Building Blocks via meshObject API
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When using the meshObject API to create a new meshTenant with a Landing Zone that has mandatory Building Blocks,
these Building Blocks will be created automatically as well. This will work only in cases when there is no
input required by the application team or platform operators.
Using Building Block dependencies in this case is supported as well.
Please note, the Building Blocks created this way will stay in a "Waiting for Input" state 
until replication completed in case they require a tenant replication to be run first, 
e.g. if they have an input that needs the Platform Tenant Id.

### Building Block user permissions for new Projects
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We fixed a bug where the value for user permissions on Building Block inputs
has not been calculated for new Projects when set up via the Project Creation Wizard.

### Display Tenant Quotas for workspace members

#### Description
Under very specific circumstances it was possible to create conflicting group names in managed cloud platforms based on project identifiers and tags.
There is now an additional check which prevents this from happening during project creation.

### Allow Building Block input generation on editing
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Users can now generate inputs when editing Building Block

### Fix Azure MCA Client Secret updates
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When using the "Customer Agreement" Provisioning Type for an Azure platform, the Principal Client Secret
for the Customer Agreement was overwritten with an invalid value, when you did any other changes to the 
Platform Config. This is fixed now. The Principal Client Secret will remain untouched if you do any other 
changes to the Config.

### Bugfix for Workspace Role Expiration Dates
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
In the Access Control screen (both in the Admin Area and within the Workspace
scope), changing the expiration date via keyboard input did not work
correctly if an expiration date was already set. This has now been fixed.

### New endpoint to import external cost data in meshObject API
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The new meshPartialTenantUsageReport endpoint allows you to import cost data
from external systems into meshStack. In future releases, these reports will
be picked up by the billing system of meshStack and subsequently included into
regular meshTenantUsageReports. This way, meshStack's billing features can be
used both for cost data collected by meshStack itself as well as cost data
collected by other systems.

### Integer and Boolean types for Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Building Block input and output fields can now also be integer or boolean
types and not only strings. This enables a more convenient Building Block 
development. Type compatibility is also checked on inputs that rely on output
of parent Building Blocks.

### Fix Azure Platform Subscription Owner display bug
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a display bug in the Azure Platform Config that did not properly
initialize the form validation when the configuration was set to skip the usually required
Subscription Owner entry. The config was still saved on the server correctly.

### Workspace Owner now receive budget alerts
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously only user with the role Workspace Manager did receive notifications about
budget alerts on payment methods.

### Apply 'Active' filter on workspaces, projects and platforms
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Now, when you access the overviews of workspaces, projects or platforms via the Sidebar, the data will be automatically filtered on the active state. This will provide you a more focused view and help you to find the most relevant entities to manage. While we have introduced default filtering for your convenience, you can still customize the view based on the other states.

### OSB Service provisioning during project creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now provision your OSB (Open Service Broker) services during project creation and tenant creation.

### Reverted tenants and marketplaces separation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have decided to revert the separation between tenants and marketplaces within the
project control plane. Now you can select your marketplaces within the tenants overview.

### Trigger runs for bulk-upgraded Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We now automatically trigger a new run for all Building Blocks that are upgraded via the 'bulk upgrade' functionality.

### Provide user permissions to Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We introduce a new assignment type for Building Block inputs: it is now possible to provide Building Blocks with the
information on the assigned user's including their respective project roles. This information is provided as a list of
user objects. As a result we added support for list input types, but for now those are restricted for use of the new
user permissions input type.

### Use in Landing Zone only Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now define a Building Block Definition as an integral part of setting up a new tenant in
a platform by ticking the "Use in Landing Zones only" box. You have to add this Building Block 
Definition to the intended Landing Zones.
This kind of definitions will only be available to application teams as part of a Landing Zone they select 
for their tenant. They will not appear in the Marketplace and can therefore not be added individually 
to existing tenants.

#### How to use
When creating or editing a Building Block Definition, you can set the "Use in Landing Zone only" checkbox,
to restrict the Definition accordingly. This property is not part of the versioning of a Building Block
Definition, so you can change it at any time. Existing Building Blocks won't be affected by this.

### Fix description field in Landing Zones forms in Firefox
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes the broken description form field for Landing Zones, which was not working in the
Firefox browser.

### Tenant Usage Reports include converted amounts
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The tenant usage reports delivered by the meshObject API now include converted
amounts, e.g., if an amount is given in USD, the amount in EUR is included
as well.

#### How to use
Tenant Usage Reports now include the additional properties baseAmount (i.e.,
the amount converted to EUR) and baseCurrency (i.e., EUR). All existing
properties remain unchanged. This change is backwards-compatible, so if you do
not plan to use converted amounts, no action is required from your side.

### Fix displaying CO2e emissions in report details
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that some Environmental Reports may incorrectly display total CO2e emissions in a details view.

### Admin Workspace Access Overview includes expired accesses

### Ops and Onboarding Support can approve tenant deletion
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, users with the role "Ops Support" or "Onboarding Support" weren't able to see the buttons to approve/decline a deletion in the Deleted Tenants view under Platforms in the Admin Area. This has been fixed.

### View Tenant Details for Ops Support
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, Ops Support users couldn't access tenant details by clicking on "View Details" in the Tenants overview under Platforms in the Admin Area. This was due to a loading error that prevented them from accessing the necessary tenant information. This has been fixed.

### Currency Conversion for meshObject API Chargebacks
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With this change, you will now have converted amounts in chargebacks delivered
by the meshObject API i.e., if an amount is given in USD, the amount in EUR is
included as well.

#### How to use
We use versioning for our meshObject API. If you do not require converted
amounts in the chargeback statements, and you use our API correctly by setting
the Accept header, then no changes are required from your end. If you want to
have converted amounts in the chargeback statements, you have to increase the version
in your Accept header. Simply use the Accept header application/vnd.meshcloud.api.meshchargeback.v3.hal+json
where you have previously used application/vnd.meshcloud.api.meshchargeback.v2.hal+json.
If you are still using v1 (i.e., application/vnd.meshcloud.api.meshchargeback.v1.hal+json)
and you are planning to use the new version v3, please note that v3 (and v2) uses the
term workspaceIdentifier where v1 has used the term customerIdentifier.

### Building Blocks on Tenant Dashboard

A new output type "Sign In Url" was introduced. If a string is returned with
this output type it will be used as the web console link on the platform tenant
dashboard. This mechanism can be used to return per-tenant links to the users.
If this is not set, the web console link is taken from the platform
configuration. This feature allows you to link directly to the tenant in your 
self-built platform.

### Fix Known Host edits for Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes the sometimes disabled "Known Host" button that prevented changing the
Known Hosts when editing a Building Block Definition draft version.

### Add Emergency Admin User to Workspace after expiration
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, admins were unable to add themselves as emergency users if they were already assigned to a workspace with an expiration date that had passed. Now, admins can successfully add themselves as emergency users, even if they were previously assigned to that workspace.

### Remove expired Workspace Accesses
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, if you tried to remove expired accesses of Users/Group under "Current Access" on your workspace control plane, . has resulted in not found issues. This has been fixed.

### Improve Building Block Azure Auth Input generation
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When you now generate Azure auth inputs for a Building Block Definition, the ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
input is additionally generated as a static input. It is required to tell the Terraform Provider in which
subscription the backend for the Terraform state is located.

### Colored Marking for Expired/Soon-to-Expire Workspace Access
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Identifying expired or soon-to-expire entities within your workspace could be a time-consuming task, leading to potential oversight in access management. Therefore, we have introduced a color-coded marking system, similar to the project access. Expired or soon-to-expire entities are now visually highlighted, making it easy to identify them at a glance. Now you can easily address expiring permissions and maintain a secure workspace environment.

### Fix broken replication for Tenants with reused identifier
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a regression that was introduced with v2023.20.0, that prevented tenants
that had a reused identifier (this happens if they are deleted and recreated again 
in the same project) from correctly displaying the replication result.

### Fix broken Workspace creation for new Users
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that a new user, who has never been assigned to any workspace could not 
create a new workspace.

### Show your own platform types in charts
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Before this change, all platform types that were build on your own, were shown only as one block in the 
Tenant Dashboard of the Admin Area. Now they are shown individually like any other platform type.

### Auto-Generate Platform Type identifier from name
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When creating a new Platform Type, you can now enter the display name first and the identifier will
be auto-generated based on the display name. You can still modify the identifier as you like, but in
many cases the default might just be what you want to have.

### Converted Currencies on Dashboards
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change, all foreign currencies will be now be converted to base
currency (EUR) to have an aligned view on all costs.

### Redirect to Overview after Building Block Deletion
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
In response to your feedback, we've made enhancements to your experience when dealing with building block deletions. Previously, users encountered frustrating "Not Found" errors on both the building block and its associated run control plane after deletion completion. Upon a successful deletion of a block, our panel now promptly notifies you and redirects you to the building block overview.

### Build your own platform
**Audience:** Partner, Operator, Customer, User<br>

#### Description
We are happy to introduce our new platform building functionality with this release. You can now create your own
Platform Type, which is powered by Building Blocks. This enables you to integrate basically every kind of platform
you have in your company as a platform in meshStack as long as it is supported via a Terraform Provider.
It will appear together with the out-of-the box platforms provided by meshStack. Application Teams can choose these
platforms, just like any other platform during project or tenant creation.

#### How to use
When creating a new platform, you can now pick "Create new Platform Type" in the Platform Type dropdown. This will open
a dialog where you provide an identifier, a display name and an icon for your own Platform Type. Afterwards you can simply
continue creating your platform using this own Platform Type. Next you define at least one Building Block, that 
provides a tenant id for your new platform (see separate release note for this feature). You also define a Landing Zone
for your new Platform, that uses the created Building Block as mandatory. With that, your users can start using your own
platform, just like any other platform.
We continue working on this functionality to provide more guidance and make some steps more intuitive within the next weeks.

### Building Blocks Known Host check fixed
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the Terraform Building Block runner to properly

of this form was improved.

### Fix users remaining disabled in SCIM synchronization
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
A bug in the SCIM implementation resulted in users remaining in the disabled
state even after the IdP attempted to recreate the user. This has now been
fixed.

### Payment method notifications for foreign currencies
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, payment method notifications did not consider amounts in foreign
currencies, such as USD. For example, if a payment method amount was set to
1000 EUR, and the cloud provider incurred a cost of 2000 USD, no notification
was sent. From now on, foreign currencies will be converted to EUR, and a
notification will be sent if the converted amount exceeds the payment method
limit.

### Provide Platform Tenant Id via Building Block
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
As part of the new platform building functionality in meshStack, you need an option to provide the Id of the 
tenant, that was created in your platform via a Building Block. This can be done by choosing the new assignment 
type "Platform Tenant Id" on an output of the Building Block. So once this output is available, meshStack will set 
this Platform Tenant Id internally for your tenant.

### Fix bug when patching draft definition versions
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, a server error occurred when inputs or outputs of a Building Block definition draft version
were patched in a way that would remove and then re-add an input or output with the same key.
This is fixed now.

### Generate auth inputs for azure resource groups & kubernetes
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When creating a Terraform-based Building Block Definition, you can now also generate recommended 
authentication inputs for Azure resource groups and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that are required for running the
Terraform Building Block with the right authentication.

### Renaming of URLs for Workspace in Panel
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change, we renamed the URLs inside the panel from Customer to
Workspace.

#### How to use
If you have a website bookmark, simply replace the /administration/customers part with /administration/workspaces.

### Bulk Upgrade Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
On the Building Block overview screen it is now possible to upgrade multiple Building Blocks
at once via the multi selection mechanism. The upgrade will work only for Building Blocks that
have a newer version available and need no further settings regarding new inputs or dependencies.
After the bulk upgrade finishes, an overview of each individual Building Block status is presented.

### Improve the initial Building Block Run status
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When running a Building Block for the first time, two runs would show up, 
where the first one would forever stay in the pending status.
This is now fixed and only one run will be created that reflects the correct status.

### Multi-Currency Support in Financial Reports
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now perform currency conversions in meshStack, which will help to streamline the chargeback 
process and budget management. All costs will be converted to a single base currency (EUR) for Usage Reports 
and Chargeback Statements, making it easier to keep track of expenses. Additionally, budget notifications 
will be available for AWS accounts with enabled currency conversion. Please stay tuned since we are also working 
on adding a united currency feature to the financial graphs.

### SCIM Performance Improvement
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We have optimized the SCIM implementation that will enhance performance,
particularly when handling a substantial volume of SCIM group updates directed
towards meshStack.

### Manage Landing Zones in the Platform Control Plane
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

It is now possible to list, create, edit and disable Landing Zones in the Platform Control Plane.
This allows you to manage landing zones of just that particular platform. The existing Landing Zone management
list in the Admin Area also still remains.

### Improved reload behavior of tables and lists
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
When tables or other lists were refreshed, you could notice a short flickering when data was reloaded. 
With this change, reloading data will not result in that flickering anymore. New data will just be added or if 
no data changed, there will be no visual change. To still provide feedback, that reloading
is happening, a toast message is now shown on the bottom right of your screen while loading.

### Faster feedback of new Building Block Runs
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When starting a new Building Block Run in the Building Block Control Plane of the Admin Area,
you will now get detailed information about the new run usually within 5 seconds. Before that change,
you might have seen the new Run only once the Building Block received a new status. Additionally, the
table now refreshes without flickering.

### Edit Building Block Definition draft version by default
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
If a draft version of a Building Block Definition exists, it is now preselected when editing or looking at the
details of a Building Block Definition. Before this change, the latest version of the Building Block Definition
was selected. As we see the usecase of further working on your new draft as the most common one, we changed that
default behavior.

### Keep creation order of Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The order of Building Block inputs was not deterministic. This is fixed now, so the order of Building Block 
Inputs is considered on all Building Block related objects (Definition, Building Block, Run).

### Create a Payment Method from the Payment Method Screen
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
With this change, you will now be able to create a payment method directly from the payment method screen
to streamline your budget management process.

### Fix Kubernetes Access Details

commands, which guide you how to access your Kubernetes namespace via kubectl.

### Owner role removal failing for deleted Azure tenants
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Depending on your platform configuration it could happen that the last remaining owner
role was not successfully removed when the Azure tenant was deleted, resulting in a
stuck tenant deletion. This is now fixed and the owner role is now successfully removed 
on tenant deletion.

### Fix sorting in Platform list
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Platforms were not sorted correctly in the Platform List of the Admin Area. They were only sorted by
Platform Status. Now these Platforms are sorted by Status and by Name.

### Improve Building Block Run log reloading
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The Building Block Run logs and remarks now update in the background without leading to flickering on the screen.
Additionally the Logs are now automatically scrolled to the bottom and as long as you don't scroll up, they will
automatically scroll down to new lines after a reload.

### Link Building Block Definition Total Usage
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
The Total Usage column of the Building Block Definition list now links to the filtered Building Block list.

### Fix losing new Building Block Definition inputs
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When editing the inputs of a Building Block Definition, the screen refreshed every now and then, resulting in your
changes being overwritten. This is now fixed and your changes are no longer being overwritten.

### Admin Identifier in Admin Groups Page
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
To create an Admin Group via the API, you'll need to utilize the "meshWorkspaceUserGroups" API by providing  
"Workspace identifier". With this change, your identifier is displayed on the Admin Groups tab on the Access Control page.

### Fix defining Landing Zones for Kubernetes
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It was not possible to create or edit Landing Zones of Kubernetes Platforms. This is fixed now.

### Deployment Notification in meshStack Panel

With this change, application teams can now access Workspace 
history within the Workspace area to be able to report and 
have better control over changes in a Workspace.

#### How to use
To check a Workspace history go to the "Compliance" tab on 
the Workspace area and choose the "History" sub tab.

### Admin Access Control Plane
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In this release, we've introduced a streamlined control plane layout for the Admin Access Area, enhancing Admin access 
control. This control plane includes sections for 'Current Access,' 'Access Requests,' and 'Admin Groups'. Notably, 
the 'Admin Groups' section displays user groups specific to the Partner Customer. This update provides a more efficient 
and focused admin access control experience.

### New Building Block definition version editing
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is no longer possible to just edit any Building Block definition version. From now on
only definition versions in a draft state can be edited. Once a definition version is published,
it cannot be edited anymore. This includes the editing of dependencies, inputs and outputs.
In a case a change is required for a Building Block definition, first a new draft version must be
created. Then the draft version can be edited and in the end published.
Altogether, this enables platform operators to make non-breaking changes to existing Building Blocks 
while still being able to make changes and release new features for newer Building Blocks.  
The general information of a Building Block definition (e.g. description or symbol) can still be updated any time.

### Fix SCIM Users Loading without any Filters
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, it was not possible to load all active users using the SCIM endpoint, if there were no filters specified. 
This is now fixed and the endpoint returns all existing users even if no filters are defined.

### Upgrade version of Building Block
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now upgrade Building Blocks to a new definition version
in case a newer version is available. This can be done following the
'upgrade' button on the Building Block control plane for an individual
Building Block. Currently it is only possible to upgrade one Building Block
at a time, but a bulk-upgrade feature will follow.

#### How to use
Click the 'upgrade' button on the Building Block control plane to upgrade
the selected Building Block. In the process you might be asked to provide values for
potential dependencies and missing input values that have been introduced by
the version you want to upgrade to.

### Option for SCIM Only User Management
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Now you can choose an option to manage users and groups within the 
Workspace and Admin areas exclusively via SCIM to prevent conflicts 
and double assignments when other methods are available.

#### How to use
To enable creation only via SCIM go to the Settings page on the 
Admin area and in the Manage tab switch on a "SCIM only user management" 
button. The button is switched off by default, which means that users 
and groups can be created through a diverse range of methods, including 
Panel, IDP, SCIM, and other available options.

### Automatic Building Block Status Update on control plane
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The Building Block and the Building Block Run Control Plane now refresh automatically every 5 seconds if the Building Block is not in a final state (Succeeded or Failed). That way newly triggered runs will appear eventually in the list without a user having to click the "Refresh" button manually. This includes automatically refreshing the logs of a Building Block Run.

### Dedicated Building Block notification receivers
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When you create or edit a Building Block definition, you now can add dedicated user to receive notifications
about failed Building Blocks or ones that require an operator input before they can get rolled out.
Existing Building Blocks will not have any receivers pre-filled. In order to receive notifications for them, please
visit the edit screen in the Admin area and setup one or multiple users.

### API credentials are now also shown as base64 encoded strings
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When you need Basic Authentication, for example, during meshStack's SCIM setup, you need base64 encoded credentials. meshStack now shows those next to the regular password when creating a new API user.

### Fix 'Add Building Block' in Landing Zones
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When creating/editing a Landing Zone in the Admin Area, the 'Add Building Block' button did not work. This is now fixed.

### Improve performance if Workspace User Groups are used
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Environments with a lot of Workspace User Groups faced some general performance issues, that slowed down
every request. The performance issue has been fixed now, so affected environments will perform much better
again.

### Generate auth Building Block Inputs for AWS, Azure & GCP
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When creating or editing a Terraform-based Building Block Definition, you can now generate recommended 
authentication inputs for AWS, Azure & GCP that are required for running the Terraform Building Block 
with the right authentication.

### Setting Role Recertification via API
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When you enable Workspace Role Recertification in the Settings, the system
will automatically set an expiration date when you create a
WorkspaceUserBinding or WorkspaceGroupBinding using the meshObject API. For
instance, if you've configured on the Settings page to limit a Workspace
Owner's access to 6 months, any Workspace Owner created via the API will
automatically have an expiration date of 6 months from the date they were
created.

#### How to use
To enable role recertification for users who are assigned via
WorkspaceUserBindings or WorkspaceGroupBindings via API, set a date on the
Settings page on the Compliance tab for this role, and then expiration dates
will be set automatically in meshStack.

### Fix Terraform Building Block Definition Creation
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
With the last release a bug was introduced, that prevented creation of Building Block Definitions of type Terraform.
This is fixed now.

### Set Expiration Date During Workspace Role Change
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, it was possible to change the role of existing Workspace members
via the panel without specifying an expiration date of the user role, despite
recertification settings on the Settings page being applied. This has now been
fixed.

### Fix editing of Dependent Building Block Input
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When you added an input of type "Building Block Output" to a Building Block Definition and reloaded the Inputs tab
of the Building Block Definition control plane, the dropdown value for this input was empty and the input was shown
as invalid. This is fixed now and the correct value is shown.

### Delete Building Block in Building Block Control Plane
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Administrators can now delete any building blocks in the building block control plane in the Admin Area.

#### How to use
To delete your Building Block, go to the control plane of a specific Building Block and go to "Deletion". Depending on how the deletion mode is set up, your Building Block will either delete resources or be purged in meshStack. Even if your building block is set up to delete resources, you can always still choose to purge it.

### Fix for filtering Building Blocks by version
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It was not possible to filter Building Blocks by version when providing the "v" prefix. You were able
to search for version "2", but searching for version "v2" did not work. This is fixed now.

### Fix Display of Workspace Event Details
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you go to Oragnization > Workspaces in the Admin Area and selected the History of a Workspace, you encountered an empty page when attempting to access the event details. This has been fixed.

### Workspace Status Column
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With the change, we have added a dedicated "Status" column to the Workspaces page on the Admin Area, allowing you 
to easily distinguish between active and deleted workspaces for a clearer overview.

### Improves GCP tenant deletion resilience
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that could leave GCP tenants stuck in deletion, in case some API
calls to the GCP API failed in the background.

### List tags for Partner Employees
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Partner Employees are now able to list all tags in the Admin Area. They will not be able to create or edit tags.

### Building Block dependencies on version level
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now manage dependencies between Building Blocks per Building Block Definition Version.
This results in a more flexible approach that also enables you to add dependencies to required
Building Blocks in later versions, even in cases where a previous version did not contain such
a dependency.

### Bulk Run Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
In the Admin Area's Building Block list, you can now also bulk run Building Blocks.

#### How to use
Select or filter for the Building Blocks you want to run again, click on Actions and pick "Start new Run".
This will run all selected Building Blocks again.

### Filter for Building Blocks that require operator input
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
The Building Block list in the Admin Area now supports filtering for "Waiting for Operator". As part of that 
change, there is now also a separate state for "Waiting for Dependency" when the Building Block is waiting for a 
dependency to finish running successfully. Before, you could only find these specific Building Blocks that require 
operator input in the Admin Area's Tenant list. To accommodate for this change, we have also removed the Building 
Block filtering capabilities in the Tenant List, in favor of the new Building Block list. Additionally, the 
"Actions Needed" section in the Cloud Foundation Dashboard in the Admin Area now also links to the new Building 
Block list.

### Fix Audit Logs resulting in "Not Found"
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, attempting to view audit logs under 'History' on the platform control plane resulted in a "Not Found" error page. This has been fixed.

### Project and Workspace Deletion from Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

On the Workspaces Page of the Admin Panel press the trash icon to delete a dedicated Workspace. If there 
are still Projects associated with this Workspace, you will be prompted to navigate to the Projects page where 
you can see a full list of Projects related to this Workspace. Here, you can delete your Projects by also 
clicking the trash icon. Keep in mind that in the process of Project deletion Tenants, will be automatically 
removed as well. Service Instances and Building Blocks have to be deleted individually. As a final step, don??t 
forget to approve the deleted tenant on the Deleted Tenants page and then delete the Workspace.

### Fix a rare issue during Project creation
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
We found out about an unlikely case where Project creation would not work anymore
due to a fragile calculation of the TenantPlatformNumber, which can be used in 
tenant naming patterns. This is fixed now.

### Workspace Role Expiry Date Settings
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change, you can now make expiration dates for Workspace roles mandatory through the settings pages to 
control. Namely, you can control the duration of access for Workspace by setting a maximum access period for 
dedicated roles. For example, with a 6-month limit for Workspace Owner, users can't be assigned to 
Workspace Owner Role for longer than 6 months. If you don't make a selection in Settings, the expiration 
functionality will remain optional for users, meaning they can choose to set an expiration date without any 
limitation or leave it unspecified.

#### How to use
Navigate to the Settings page, and within the Compliance tab, select a time frame for a particular role.

### Fixes Workspace re-creation via meshObject API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### How to use
Navigate to Settings > Inputs on the building block control plane. Put your new inputs into the form and press 'Save & Run'. If you want to start a completely new run without changing any inputs, just click on 'Start new Run' in the building block control plane's run tab. It will use the settings you have in the 'Inputs' tab to execute the run.

### Load Building Block inputs from Terraform variables
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When creating or editing a Building Block definition, you can now automatically generate Building Block inputs by pasting in the Terraform variables code.

### Building Block notification links to new pages
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Notifications for Building Blocks with required actions (failed, operator input) now link to the new table of
Building Blocks in the Building Block Control Plane in the Admin Area.

### Fix Permanently hidden Onboarding Guide Overlay
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
We recently introduced an overlay, that aims to guide
users through their onboarding when they create a new
workspace. Due to a recent change, the overlay was unintentionally permanently
hidden. This is now fixed and the overlay now will only be hidden when a user clicks
on the 'Hide Permanently' option.

### Fix for AWS replication regarding group deletion
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We found an issue within the AWS replication that occurred
while deleting an AWS tenant. This resulted in tenants being 
stuck in the deletion process forever. The issue has been 
removed, so AWS tenant deletion works as expected again.

### View details of a specific Building Block Run
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have introduced a Building Block Run Control Plane in the admin area where you can see the details of an executed run, such as the logs, inputs & outputs of that particular run.

### Permanently hide Onboarding Guide Overlay
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
We recently introduced an overlay, that aims to guide
users through their onboarding when they create a new
workspace.
This overlay can now be permanently hidden by every user
as a personal preference. Simply click on the button 
'Hide Permanently' and the overlay will not pop up again.

### Handle Building Block definition draft versions
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
As a preparation for the upcoming versioning of Building Block
definitions we added the functionality to create and edit draft
versions. This has no impact on existing Building Blocks. 
New Building Blocks will be created with the most recent version,
that is not a draft.
For now, all versions can still be edited, but in the future, 
only draft versions will be eligible for editing, so that 
already published versions can no longer be changed.

### Expiration date for Workspace roles
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
We've added an expiration date feature for Workspace roles. So when you
assign user or group to a Workspace, you can now optionally specify an
expiration date. Furthermore, this expiry date can be extended by another
user with a Workspace Owner or Manager Role at their convenience.
After the specified expiry date has passed, the user or group will no longer have
access to the assigned Workspace. Conversely, if no expiry date is set, the
user or group will enjoy permanent access to the Workspace.

### Bulk Deletion and Purging of Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
In the Admin Area you can now select individual Building Blocks from the list to delete or purge
these Building Blocks. You can also apply a filter and delete or purge all Building Blocks that match
this filter.

#### How to use
Go to the Building Block List in the Admin Area. Use the checkboxes in the list to select Building Blocks individually. 
Alternatively you can use the checkbox in the first column of the header row to select all Building Blocks that match the current
filter criteria. When the correct blocks are selected, you click on the "Actions" dropdown above the list. In the
dropdown you can either select Delete or Purge and the number of affected Building Blocks is shown to you. After selecting
Delete or Purge, a confirmation dialog pops up, that shows you all affected Building Blocks again.

### Select Favorites in Admin Sidebar

As a preparation for the upcoming versioning of Building Block
definition we added a button to publish the currently shown
draft version on the Building Block Definition control plane.
Stay tuned for an upcoming release where we will introduce a fully working
Building Block definition versioning feature.

### Fix meshProject stuck in pending deletion
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
In rare cases if you deleted a meshProject that contains only a single Marketplace tenant, 
your project remained in a pending deletion state. This is fixed now, but the update process can take up 1 hour.

### Fix sending Building Block notifications to all users
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If a Building Block failed or required operator input, all users who were assigned to any workspace
received an email. Those workspace users won't receive these notifications anymore. Only Partner Admins,
Partner Employees and Platform Operators will receive those emails now.
With the next release, we will provide the actually intended behavior of sending the Building Block failed
notification also to Workspace users for Building Blocks that belong to their workspace.

### Building Block Definitions can use a specific git commit
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When you define a Building Block Definition based on Terraform, you can now fix
the repository source to a specific git commit that will be used when
the Building Block is applied.

### Fix Sensitive User Input not showing
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you wanted to add building block to your tenant (as a workspace user), which requires a sensitive input, the input was not rendered.

### View runs in the Building Block Control Plane
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have introduced a building block control plane in the admin area where you can manage one specific Building Block.
You can already check out the runs for a building block on that control plane. Note that older runs might have the state 'Succeeded',
even if they have failed.
Please stay tuned, as we will incrementally integrate more Building Block-related functionalities in the upcoming weeks.

### Improvement of Sidebar User Interface
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We are excited to unveil a refined user interface within the Admin Panel sidebar. This enhancement encompasses a
redesigned collapsible sidebar that would intuitively cater to your need, creating a seamless alignment with your 
preferences, and keeping insight into exactly the category you want to work on.

### Prevent use of Terraform with incompatible license
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Since August 10th, Hashicorp announced a change in the licensing of Terraform which impacts
the use of Terraform >1.5.5 in meshStack Building Blocks. We are actively investigating options to keep
supporting Terraform beyond this license change, but as a preventive measure, we prohibit the
use of Terraform versions higher than 1.5.5.
Please stay tuned as we explore the possibility of extending our support to upcoming Terraform versions.
We are also evaluating the potential support for openTF. This initiative seeks to provide an
open-source alternative to the official Hashicorp Terraform provider.

### Disable Azure Subscription Owner entity requirement
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A flag introduced into the Azure platform configuration allows
to bypass the Subscription Owner setting. This can be useful when a user
group already carries the 'Owner' role and additional fallback 'Owner' 
principals are not required anymore.

### Open Service Broker context object contains workspace_id
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
After we have already renamed customer to workspace in most places in
meshStack, we have now introduced this renaming in the JSON payload sent from
meshStack to the Open Service Broker. To avoid breaking changes, your existing
Open Service Broker implementations remain compatible with meshStack, but you can
now start migrating your Open Service Brokers.
In particular, the context object sent from meshStack to your Open Service
Broker implementation now contains the key workspace_id in addition to the
already existing key customer_id. The value of workspace_id is identical to
the value of customer_id in order to remain backwards-compatible. However, the
customer_id key is considered deprecated and will be removed in the
future (we will not introduce breaking changes without prior
notice). To migrate your Open Service Broker implementation, simply replace
context.customer_id by context.workspace_id. Feel free to reach out to us if
you require any assistance.

### Show private service instances in Workspace Control Plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If deletion of a Service Instance that belongs to a private Service Broker failed, it did not appear in the
list of Failed Instances on the Marketplace tab in the Workspace Control Plane. This is fixed now, so also these
instances appear in the Failed Instances list and can be purged from there.

### Building Block Definition I/O patching update
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We improved the patching mechanism for updating existing Building Block definition versions
in order to prevent previous bugs. It is no longer possible to delete or modify outputs of a
Building Block definition that are needed as input for dependent Building Block definitions.
Furthermore, it is no longer possible to modify outputs of manual Building Blocks, as they 
are always generated from the defined inputs.

### Version selection for Building Block Definition
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
As a preparation for the upcoming versioning of Building Block
definition we added a dropdown to select the currently shown
version data on the Building Block Definition control plane.
Stay tuned for an upcoming release where we will introduce a fully working
Building Block definition versioning feature.

### Show Global Groups and Partner Admin Groups
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, an issue occurred where the Partner Groups were unintentionally overwritten, resulting in the display of only Global Groups. This issue has been successfully resolved. This is fixed and you can now seamlessly view both Global Groups and Partner Admin Groups directly on their respective dedicated pages within the sidebar.

### Grant Global Groups access to Workspace during its creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now grant Global Groups access to your Workspace during its creation. Previously, only Users could be granted access, and Global Groups would have to be assigned after creating the Workspace.

### Fix "View More" in the Groups Screen
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you access the User Groups Screen, you couldn't see the "View more" link anymore. This has been fixed.

non-Latin characters are accepted.

### Enable Dependency Output as Input when editing Definitions
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to add new inputs of type "Building Block Output" to existing Building Block Definitions.
Additionally you can now see details of Building Block Outputs in the Building Block Definition Control Plane.
Before this fix, you only saw an empty input field.

### Fix Run execution with newly added inputs
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you added inputs of the source type 'Platform Operator' subsequently to a definition, the input fields were missing in the run dialog of the related building blocks. Due to the missing fields, you could not enter the required values to execute the run. This has been fixed.

### Sidebar Searchbox
**Audience:** Partner<br>

have been incorporated. Moreover, existing Customer tags remain unaltered and fully functional 
to ensure seamless backward compatibility.

### Regroupement of Pages in the Admin Panel Sidebar
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have optimized the Admin Panel sidebar by reorganizing pages into intuitive 
categories to better align with your workflow and make it easier to find what 
you need! For example, the Access Control category contains all elements 
related to user and group management, both within the Admin and Workspace 
Panels. Moreover, we've introduced a new Support item in the sidebar, which 
provides a direct link to our dedicated support email, streamlining your access 
to assistance. It's important to note that the support links in the footer 
remain fully functional and continue to serve as a valid means for application 
teams to connect with you.

### Renaming Default Patterns in Platform Configuration
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Continuing the migration to Workspace naming we have renamed default patterns in all platform configs from 
#{customerIdentifier} to #{workspaceIdentifier}. For example 'Group Name Pattern', 'Project Name Pattern', 
and similar. For backward compatibility, previous patterns will also continue to work.

### Fix Building Block Inputs with "size" name not working
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
When creating a Building Block Input that has the name "size", the Building Block Input would not be visible when a workspace user
would create a new Building Block. This is now fixed and Building Block Inputs with the name "size" are visible and working again.

### New Settings Page on Admin Panel
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We introduce a dedicated Settings page within the Admin Panel, designed to serve as the centralized hub for all 
your meshStack configuration needs. In this first version, the Settings page will encompass the ability to modify 
your logo. We eagerly invite you to share your insights on what additional features you envision for the settings

With the previous release, we transitioned valuable charts from 
the Performance page to Dashboards to be able now to deprecate the 
Performance page. By deprecating the Performance page, we streamline 
your access to critical data in one place - Dashboard page! 
The following charts were transitioned to the Dashboard page: 
Total Amount of Project Overtime, Total Amount of Tenants 
per Platform Type Over Time and Shares of Tenants per Platform Type.

### Improved Lookup for Workspace User Assignments
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this change, the lookup for user emails during an assignment 
to a Workspace will be matched against their external user ID, which
increases reliability.

### Fixes Tenant Usage Report generation instability

that displays the distribution of tenants across different platform 
types so that you will have a clear view of your cloud landscape components.

### Fix Recreation of Customer Bindings
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
When the meshObject Declarative Import API was used to import a
meshCustomerGroupBinding or meshCustomerUserBinding, and one of the bindings
provided in the payload already existed, then this binding was first deleted
and then recreated if the old role names were used by the client. This has now
been fixed.

### View of Dashboard Sections
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Users with a Platform Operator role in the Admin Panel can now 
easily access the Access Needed Sections, Cloud Universe, and 
Marketplace sections of the Dashboard page to get a better 
overview of the platform infrastructure.

On the Dashboard page's Tenant Tab, we have included a 
new chart that displays the number of tenants over time 
for each platform. This chart makes it easy for you to 
monitor the growth of your cloud landscape, enabling you 
to make informed decisions and generate reports on progress 
seamlessly.

### Accumulated Projects Chart
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have introduced a new chart on the Dashboard page showcasing 
the total number of projects created on a monthly basis. This 
enhancement enables you to track your project progress effortlessly 
and stay updated with accomplishments.

### Improves tag replication for mixed replication settings
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This improvement fixes a bug that led to the wrong replication values
when a tag was applied to a meshProject, meshWorkspace and a Payment Method
and had different replication settings applied.
It also adds checks and warnings if a tag is created that uses an tag key
which only differs in its case from already existing tags. This will now
lead to a conflict error message.

### Fix rare case where users could not be added to projects
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
On rare occasions, there could have been a database inconsistency that lead to errors when users
were added to projects. The cause for this inconsistency has been fixed.

### Filter Building Block List
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The list of all Building Blocks in the Admin Area can now be filtered by all columns. That way you can
for example easily find all Building Blocks, that belong to a certain Building Block Definition.

### Improved performance of meshWorkspaceUserGroup API import
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When importing via the meshObject API a meshWorkspaceUserGroup with hundreds of members into a meshWorkspace
with hundreds of meshProjects, performance issues caused potential timeouts for those imports. The root causes
for the performance issues have been identified and fixes have been implemented. Therefore performance is
now significantly improved for this import. The timeout issues should not appear again.

### Fix Read-only Form Appearance
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To provide a clear appearance of non-editable form fields, 
we have applied the gray background to input fields that are read-only.

### Increased limit of meshWorkspaces for users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
If a user was assigned to more than 100 meshWorkspaces, only 100 meshWorkspaces were available
in the Navigation Bar at the top. This limit has been increased to 250 now.

### Fix for updating sensitive Building Block Definition inputs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When a Building Block Definition input was marked as sensitive and later
edited the value update was not properly handled, resulting in a broken
Building Block deployment. This has been fixed.

### Marketplace tenant deletion AAD group cleanup
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When you use a marketplace replication that also sets up AAD user group for permissions purposes,
the deletion of the project and thus global marketplace will also cleanup and delete the created
AAD groups.

### Improves stability of deleting meshTenants
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This fixes two bugs that could lead to stuck deleted tenants if the deleting replication failed.
The replication now also correctly re-tries tenant deleting replications that have failed.

### Fix Project Search in Workspaces Area
**Audience:** Partner, User, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, on the Projects Overview page of a Workspaces Area, if you entered
a search term and there were no existing mesProjects that matched the search,
the search bar would disappear. Now, this issue has been resolved, and the
search input will always remain visible.

### Maintain OSB Dashboard client support with meshIdB
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
For meshStacks with an upgraded meshIdB (Keycloak v19.0.3), integrating with OSB dashboards
was broken. This is now fixed. Please note, however, that the OSB dashboard feature is deprecated.
As an alternative, we highly recommend using Azure Active Directory groups permission replication
through marketplace replication.
Visit our documentation to learn more: https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.meshmarketplace.index.html#aad-permission-replication.
If this option does not work, we recommend using the meshObject API to get Authorization information out of meshStack and into your desired system.

### Fix running replication indicator in Tenant Details
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When you triggered the replication in the past, the indicator badge at the top in the Tenant Details always showed "Replication is running..." even though the rest of the page showed the finished replication results. This has been fixed.

### Renaming Customer Roles to Workspace Roles
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
To maintain consistency with the renaming of meshCustomer to meshWorkspace, we have also renamed the roles. So that, the 'Customer Owner' role is now called 'Workspace Owner', 'Customer Admin' is now referred to as 'Workspace Manager', and 'Customer Employee' is now 'Workspace Member'.

or 'Deletion in Progress'. We fixed a bug within the synchronization mechanism that solves these problems for
Building Blocks during creation or deletion.

### Fix display of building block logs and remarks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We have resolved an issue where you were only able to see the logs and remarks of the 
first selected building block on the tenant control plane in the Admin Area.
You should now be able to access all relevant logs and remarks of the selected building block without having to reload the page.

### Filter our Expired Payment Methods
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this release, we have introduced the Payment Method expiration statuses and filtering. This would help you 
keep track of your payment method's expiration status and easily filter on Active, Expiring Soon, and Expired methods. 
You would stay in control of your payments with this new feature.
On the Payment Methods page, filter out in the Expiration Status column on Active Payment Methods to see 
only valid once or on Expiring Soon to control Payment Methods, which are close to expiration day

### Terraform Building Block support for file inputs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The Terraform Building Blocks now have a new input option: File. This allows
the operator to feed in smaller files into the Building Blocks to access them
during execution. Usually this is used for files containing authentication
information. The name of the input is used as the file name and the file is
put into the working directory of the Terraform script execution.

### Fix the deactivation of published Service Broker

#### Description
Deactivating a published Service Broker failed with an error. This is fixed
and published Service Brokers can be deactivated successfully now.

### Add multiple Building Blocks to existing meshTenants
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to add multiple Building Blocks to an existing meshTenant at once. This includes
a complete restyling of the screen, where you can add Building Blocks to an existing meshTenant. It is 
now the same UX for selecting Building Blocks as during meshProject and meshTenant creation.

### Upgraded meshPanel design system
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have upgraded a central library in the meshPanel that drives the visual design system, and gives a fresher look and feel of the meshPanel. We did everything we can to give you a smooth transition, but if you do find an issue, let us know at support@meshcloud.io.

### Prevent default tag selection on policy violation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, tags were set to the default value during meshProject and meshWorkspace creation even 
if the default value conflicted with an active policy. With this change, we have disabled predefined 
tags during meshWorkspace and meshProject creation if it conflicts with an active policy, making it 
easier for you to have and choose the right tag from the list.

### Azure cost item collection improvements

### Fix meshTenant Import not working for Kubernetes platforms
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, meshTenant Imports for Kubernetes, Azure Kubernetes Service & OpenShift would not work.
This is now fixed and you can now import Namespaces/Projects for these platforms by referencing the 
namespace/project name as the localId in the meshTenant Import.
As a minor consequence, meshTenants of these platform types are now always referencing the namespace/project
name as the localId of the platform, and no longer the Kubernetes resource uid.

### Custom tenant naming pattern for Kubernetes-based platforms
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Kubernetes, Azure Kubernetes Service and OpenShift platform integrations now have the ability to 
leverage custom tenant naming patterns. The tenant naming pattern can be configured in the platform
configuration screen in the Admin Area for the respective platform.

### Remove Building Block definitions from Landing Zones
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, deleting a Building Block definition could cause an error in the Landing Zone screen when a definition is referenced as a mandatory or recommended definition in a Landing Zone. Now, a definition will be automatically removed from all referenced Landing Zones and you can remove the definition without any issues.

### Transparency on Project Limitations
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, you would only find out about reaching the project 
limit when you reached the final page of creating a meshProject. 
Now, if you reach the project limit, you will be notified 
right from the start. A warning sign will appear with a 
clear message when you attempt to click the Create 
Project button.

### Discover Suitable Landing Zone at a Glance
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We have made improvements to the platform selection process. During the 
meshProject creation process, you will now be able to see in advance 
if a platform does not have any complaint Landing Zones available to 
have a smoother platform selection process.

After changing the static value of an input and re-running the Building Block the new value will be applied.

### Change Building Block implementation type
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Platform Operators are now able to change the implementation type of their Building Block definitions. This makes it 
possible to define manual Building Blocks and later switch to a Terraform-backed automation.

### Separation of Marketplace
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
To enhance transparency in your meshProject, we separated Marketplace from the Tenants tab. So that Tenant tab 
focuses specifically on tenants associated with cloud services, enabling easy access to cloud-related information. 
On the other hand, the Marketplaces tab exclusively showcases Marketplaces, allowing you to conveniently explore 
and engage with various marketplace options.

### Navigation after meshWorkspace Creation
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We have enhanced the meshWorkspace creation process by introducing automatic redirection. 
Once a meshWorkspace is created, you will be automatically directed to it for easy access 
to relevant information and tools. If you are not assigned to the created meshWorkspace, 
you will be redirected to your existing meshWorkspace or to Administration Panel.

We have renamed meshCustomer to meshWorkspace. The new term is more intuitive
and universally understandable, thereby increasing user-friendliness,
especially for first-time users.

### Fixing view for currently deleting meshTenants
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, in the Administration Area view at Platforms > Tenants you could not access the tenant control plane 
of tenants in pending deletion by clicking "View more". This has been fixed.

### Adapted look and feel of Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We want to improve the administration around the Building Block topic. Therefore, we implemented a top-level control plane in the Administration Area. Please stay tuned, as we will introduce more functionality in the upcoming weeks!

### Improved Project Access Control
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We enhanced the meshProject Access Control page by allowing you to easily unassign 
multiple users at once. Additionally, the meshProject creation page now has a 
centered view, improving visibility and user experience during review and input.

### Fix Building Block private repository not working
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
With this release we fixed a bug that prevented the correct execution of Building Blocks with sources from private 
repositories. This bug was accompanied by the error message 'Your private key appears to be invalid'.

### Improved meshCustomer Creation Review Screen
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we have made significant enhancements to the meshCustomer Review & Create screen, providing a 
complete overview of inputs by displaying all users who have the meshCustomer role, along with corresponding tags 
for meshCustomer.

### Improved UX for invalid Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
When creating a meshProject or a meshTenant, incomplete or invalid Building Blocks were only indicated
via an exclamation mark icon. This could be overseen easily. Therefore we now show an additional info box
before the "next" button for easily understanding, that some Building Blocks have not been successfully
configured. Additionally from now on the first mandatory Building Block will automatically be
expanded, so it is clear and easy to provide input for it.

### Fix Terraform Building Block Definitions using SSH
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
With the last release, a bug was introduced, that prevented saving Building Block Definitions that were
using SSH for accessing Git without defining the Known Host Entry. This is fixed now and Building Block
Definitions can be saved again without defining a Known Host Entry.

### Improved deletion handling of pending Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
If a Building Block used the "Delete Resources" deletion mode and is still waiting for input, it could
not been deleted before. An operator had to manually purge this block. meshStack now identifies these
situations and purges Building Blocks, if they have never been executed.

### Purge Building Block
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Building Blocks can now always be purged by Platform Operators and Partners in the Admin Area. This enables
resolving issues with stuck Building Blocks or Blocks where tf destroy did not work as expected and was resolved
manually. With the new purge functionality, those Building Blocks can now be easily removed in meshStack.

#### How to use
Go to the Building Block section of the Tenant Detail Screen in the Admin Area and select a Building Block. Besides executing
a Building Block again and deleting a Building Block, you can now also purge the Building Block.

### Fix rare case of stuck Building Block deletion
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
In rare cases, Building Block Deletion got stuck and prevented any execution of a Building Block on the same meshTenant.
This is fixed now.

### Improve SCIM user detection robustness
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Unclean datasets in the user identity source system can lead to a poor
experience when initial SCIM user sync happens. A username mismatch often
fails to detect potentially existing user in the meshStack user database.
This kept some users out of the automatic sync process.
This discovery logic was improved to decrease errors during initial user
matching.

### Building Block deletion improvement
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
There was a bug that could prevent the successful deletion of a child
building block. This behavior was fixed.

### Support self-hosted Git repositories in Building Blocks
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now use any Git provider or Git server for Terraform Building Blocks. It is now possible to add a 
known host entry, so meshStack can verify that it is actually talking to the correct Git host. That way, 
you can now use any Git provider or self-hosted Git server, by just providing its public key as a known host.

#### How to use
When creating or updating a Building Block Definition, you can optionally provide the known host information if you
are using a Terraform Building Block with SSH access to the Git repository. The required known host information is 
the host of the Git server, the encryption algorithm that is used for communication and the base64 encoded public key
of your Git server.
With this information, meshStack can verify that it is actually talking to the correct Git server and a man-in-the-middle
attack can be prevented.

for March and April Chargeback statements.

### Dependencies of Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Dependencies between Building Blocks can now be defined in meshStack. Operators can explicitly define that a Building Block depends on another Building Block. They can also define which outputs of the parent Building
Block shall be mapped to which inputs of the dependent Building Block. This enables implementation of use cases such as a VM Block, that depends on a Network Block. The Network Block needs to exist first, and provide the network ID to 
the VM service, so the VM gets connected to the expected network. Application Teams can only add a Building Block that depends on another Building Block to their meshTenant if the parent Building Block already exists on their Tenant.

#### How to use
If the execution of the parent Building Block is still in progress and no outputs exist yet, the dependent Building 
Block will stay in a Pending state. It will be processed once the parent Building Block completed successfully and provided the required outputs.

often lead to failures when adding or deleting users from this group via meshObject API. 
The internal handling was improved and bigger groups are now supported.

### Improves deep link support in notifications
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The notification system now has better support for deep linking into the meshPanel.
This allows the creation of links that directly take the reader of a notification message
to the right place in the panel. At the moment this is used only available for notifications 
targeting manual Building Block creation.

### Environment variables for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We added the option to declare Building Block inputs
as environmental variables. This will change the way 
how those inputs are interpreted. This option has no
relevance for manual Building Blocks, but will be used
by the upcoming implementation for Building Blocks
backed by Terraform e.g. to define Terraform Provider
configuration.

### Building Block Deletion during meshTenant deletion

maximum allowed active payment methods from 250 to 350 per meshCustomer.

### Irreversible deletion of a meshPlatform
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We replaced the deactivation of meshPlatform in the Admin Panel with a deletion option. So when you choose a deletion option for a specific meshPlatform, you will not be able to choose it for new tenant creation. Moreover, after the meshPlatform deletion, you will not have access to related tenants via meshStack.
In contrast to deactivation, the deletion can not be reverted. Once you delete a meshPlatform, no replication will be executed, and you will not have any chargeback statements for related tenants.  However, you can still directly access the platform tenants in the cloud platform.

#### How to use
On the meshPlatforms screen on the Admin Panel, you could select the needed meshPlatform and navigate to the 'Danger Zone' tab. There you can either (un)do a deprecation or with a new option irreversible delete the meshPlatform.

### Fixes AWS user permissions for multiple meshRole mapping
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
This fixes the regression that was introduced with v1.160.0: If an AWS Landing Zone mapped
multiple meshRoles to the same AWS Role it broke the user permission assignment process.
This left some users without access to the affected tenant in AWS.

### Fix in the Tenants section of the Admin Dashboard

**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, if your meshStack is configured to require a payment method during meshCustomer creation, 
you were not able to use a payment method / cost center that was already used by another meshCustomer. 
An error message was shown instead. This is fixed now and you are again able to reuse 
the payment method that was already assigned to another meshCustomer.

### Fix numeric tag validation
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
A validation error was shown for valid numeric tags when entering the tag edit screen of meshObjects, i.e payment method. This also prevented saving changes to any tags on that screen.

This is fixed now.

### Data reliability improvements for meshTenant replication
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
There was a rare case of potential dataloss during replication this means that the 
tenant detail view information might not necessarily return the latest data. The 
chance for this happening was very small and so far never observed. 
But with upcoming replication improvements and cleanup operations, the integrity 
of this data becomes more important. Internal data handling of the replicator was 
improved. That fixes this issue and also makes project access faster and more 
reliable.

### No templated link parts in meshObject GET API
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshObject GET API endpoints partly had templated links in them.
Templated links contain information on additional possible
query parameters, but have the drawback to not work directly without
additional processing. These templated links have been changed to
regular ones, so that they can be used as intended.

### Payment Method filter for meshProject GET API
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshProject GET API endpoint has been extended with a new filter option. You can now specify a 
'paymentIdentifier' to find only meshProjects that have the payment method with the given identifier

### Graphs in Admin Dashboard show accumulated data
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The Tenant and User graph in the Admin Dashboard have previously shown the
growth of each month, i.e., how many tenants or users have been newly created
in the given month. Now, we show the accumulated data. This means that for
each month, the number refers to the total number of users/tenants that have
existed in that month.

### Clickable Project Hint Messages
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If a project is missing a payment method or if you are not a member of this project, 
related hint messages are shown in the project overview of the Customer Control Plane 
and in the header of the Project Control Plane. With this change those hints are now clickable.

view within the administration area.

### Mandatory Subscription Owner in Azure platform config
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When providing the replication configuration for a meshPlatform with platform
type Azure, a Subscription Owner Object ID is now mandatory if the
provisioning type is Enterprise Enrollment. Previously, this field was not
mandatory in the web interface, but was actually required for successful
replication, thus resulting in failed replications if the user hadn't provided
a Subscription Owner.

### Fix in the Financials section of the Admin Dashboard
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The "Financials" section of the new dashboard in the Admin Area previously
included all costs, including those from tenants not managed by meshStack as
well as costs from private meshMarketplaces. For some customers, this has
resulted in unreasonably high cost numbers. That is why we now include only
costs from tenants that are managed by meshStack.

### Continue Chargeback for deleted Tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, the chargeback statement generation was based only on existing tenant information
for the respective period. Now when you delete the tenant, the  chargeback statement process 
will incorporate chargeback statements for all related costs to a missing tenant as long as 
cloud costs still occur.

### Chargeback generation fix for empty reports
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
There was a rare issue during generation of Chargeback Statements in case the respective usage reports
had no line items. This led to missing Chargeback Statements. The issue was fixed now so that those
Chargeback Statements will be generated with zero costs.

### New Dashboard in Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The first step of having your cloud foundation at a glance is here: a new menu item in the Admin area called "Dashboard" has been added.
The first version of the dashboard enables you to view general information about tenants, financials, users, compliance, and marketplace.
Please stay tuned, as we will extend this dashboard with more information in the coming weeks & months!

### Fix Tenant Usage Report Generation
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With release v7.152.0 we introduced an issue that broke
Tenant Usage Report generation, if a lot of usage reports
exist. This is fixed now.

### Add finalized flag to Chargeback CSV and API
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Chargeback Statements can either be preview or finalized statements. To be able to identify
this difference, the finalized flag is now set in the Chargeback Statement CSV export
and in the meshChargeback Read API.

#### How to use
In the CSV export, it is added after the SellerProductGroup column. Via the meshChargeback Read API,
the flag can be found in the metadata of a meshChargeback. It is also possible to filter meshChargebacks
via their finalization status to e.g. only retrieve finalized meshChargebacks.

### Clean up non-finalized Preview Chargebacks
**Audience:** Customer, Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change we introduce a mechanism that regularly removes Preview Chargeback Statements from past periods in case
they have not been finalized. For example, not finalizing a Preview Chargeback Statement can happen if the underlying 
usage reports cannot be finalized due to some collection issues. In those cases the Preview Chargeback Statements 
should be deleted, as the usage reports will be part of an upcoming Chargeback Statement once the usage report is finalized.

### Extend service broker error message
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, standard error messages were shown for a few service broker errors. We improved the error messages in the panel by displaying detailed information if available.

### Fix tag moving to end of list after saving
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
As an admin, when saving an existing tag in the tag catalog, the tag would automatically be moved to the bottom of
the list. This is now fixed and the tag will maintain its position in the list.

### Improvement of service broker error message
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We improved a few error messages of the service broker by providing more information. So, that you can identify issues related to the service broker more conveniently.

### Send notifications when tenant fails replication
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Notifications can be configured to be sent via e-mail or Slack when tenant
replication has failed so that operators are immediately aware of replication issues.

### Fixing GCP platform config default value
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The default parameter for the new introduced GCP user lookup strategy was not applied properly. 
That prevented the replication for existing meshPlatforms of type GCP and also the panel to display
the GCP platform config. This has been fixed.

### Sorting and Filtering for Admin Project Overview
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We introduced filtering and sorting capabilities to the Project Overview screen 
in the Admin area. This allows you to filter and sort by project, customer, status, and payment.

#### How to use
Navigate to Projects > Project Overview within the Admin area. There you can apply filters
as necessary.

### Additional User lookup options for Azure and GCD
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
This adds the experimental feature of looking up users with their externalId user property in GCD and
onPremiseSamAccountName in Azure. The same value must configured as the EUID in the meshUser entity for
these lookups to work.
For more information regarding EUIDs, check the documentation of the platform configurations for 
<a href="https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.azure.index.html#external-user-ids-euid">Azure</a> 
and <a href="https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.gcp.index.html#cloud-identity-setup">GCD</a>.

#### How to use
In the Azure and GCP platform configuration in the Admin area the new user lookup strategy can be setup in the replicator section.

### Project Overview screen
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
There is a new menu item in the Admin area called "Project Overview". It links to a new
screen that lists all meshProjects of all meshCustomers in an overview together with the
respective meshProject status, the assigned payment method and the platform instances.
Furthermore, the previous "Deleted Projects" screen has been removed in favor of the recently
introduced "Deleted Tenants" screen, that resides within the Platforms submenu.

### Updated group API endpoint
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Addressing user groups only via the customerUserGroup identifier is now deprecated. As group identifiers are only
unique within a meshCustomer, this could have led to finding more than one group by identifier, which resulted in an
error. The endpoint has been changed to use the format "meshCustomer-identifier.meshCustomerUserGroup-identifier". 
Please always use this composed identifier from now on.

#### How to use
For backward-compatibility it is still possible to retrieve a meshCustomerUserGroup only via the group identifier,
but this is now deprecated and will be removed end of December. Please adapt your existing implementations
to always request a single meshCustomerUserGroup via the composed identifier.
For global groups, the customer identifier is "meshcloud-global-partner".

### Fix options in project creation on small screens
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you have been adding information for a new project on a small screen, drop-down menus were cut off. Now you are able to add project information on a small screen without limitations.

### Improved handling of expired payment methods
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
If rolling of expired payment method is enabled in a meshStack installation, it will now
unset the payment method on a meshProject if the payment method expired and no substitute
payment method exists. This change makes it more transparent, that a valid payment method
is missing on a meshProject. The meshCustomer sees an according warning directly on the
Customer and Project Control Planes. Making the customer more aware to actually set a valid 
payment method, makes sure that costs related to the meshProject can be charged again as 
soon as possible.

### Deprecation of meshPlatforms
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to deprecate a meshPlatform. This is useful when you have a platform that is
still in use, but you no longer encourage customers to make use of this platform.
When a platform is deprecated by the Platform Operator, Customer Users can still fully access the 
existing tenants of the platform, but it is no longer possible to create new tenants for this platform.
A small indicator symbol in the project overview, as well as in the tenant dashboard, is added to 
inform the user that the tenant exists in a deprecated platform.

### Syncing from LDAP to meshStack supports nullable attributes
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
If you are using meshStack's identityconnector to sync groups and users from LDAP to meshStack you can now specify attributes that not every user or group has.
For example meshStack can now use the mail attribute for users and the userPrincipalName for Service Accounts that do not have the mail attribute set.
Contact meshcloud support for more information.

### Improved service processing after project creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the processing of services that have been selected during project creation. Previously it could have taken up to a day until they were processed. Now, they will be processed as soon as the service broker processed the service instance.

### Fixes OpenStack new tenant replications
**Audience:** Operator, User, Partner<br>

#### Description
A regression was fixed that lead to the failure of replication for
new Open Stack tenants.

### Fix Tenant Usage Report finalization
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
With a change in the billing system from September 2022 a bug was introduced that led to
Tenant Usage Reports being modified even after their initial finalization time. As
a result, line items from Usage Reports have been booked to a Chargeback Statement
one month late. (e.g. Reports from October are included in November's Chargeback) 
This has been fixed now, so for all future Chargeback Statements (beginning in December)
the items from the reports will be assigned correctly.

### Smart polling for for Service Instance
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Marketplace behavior has been updated so it does not poll for the status of Service Instances
and Service Bindings forever. Instead, it will now respect the maximum polling duration value from the
Service Plan configuration according to the Open Service Broker specification. Furthermore,
the polling interval will be reduced over time. In case no maximum polling duration is provided
the Marketplace will stop polling automatically after a duration of 14 days. When polling is
stopped on Service Instances or Service Bindings the respective entity is set to failed state.

### Fix unresponsive meshPanel
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
A bug that lead to a unusual high load on the backend, if a project with a lot
of assigned users (>100) existed was fixed.

### Fixed admin area projects not showing
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In a previous release a bug was introduced where some projects of a customer would not be visible in the admin area. This is now fixed.

### meshCustomerUserGroup filtering via API
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
meshCustomers and meshUsers can now be filtered by meshCustomerUserGroup. That way you can get the meshCustomer a
certain meshCustomerUserGroup belongs to. You can also get all users who are member of a certain meshCustomerUserGroup.
meshCustomerUserGroups can now be filtered by meshCustomer or meshUser. This allows you to get all 
meshCustomerUserGroups of a certain meshCustomer or all meshCustomerUserGroups a certain meshUser is member of.

### Extend Service Broker Info in Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Service broker logs and provisioned service broker plans are now visible from the admin area.
In addition, the service broker view from the admin area now includes an additional column
to see which customer the service broker belongs to.

### Increased robustness of service instance creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When selecting services for cloud platforms during project creation, some error cases are now handled in a more robust way.

### No Budget Alerts on unassigned Payment Methods
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
We improved the notifications about Payment Methods that nearly reach or exceed the allotted budget.
There will no longer be notifications on Payment Methods that are not assigned to any meshProject anymore.

### Automatically add missing marketplace during project create
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If services are selected for a platform during meshProject creation, those services might be coming
from specific Marketplaces (e.g. one that only exists in an Azure meshLocation). When selecting such
a service, the according marketplace will now be added automatically as a meshTenant to the meshProject.

### Enables collection of GCP Carbon Model v6
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, projects that contained data from GCP Carbon Model v6 could not
be collected. This is now fixed.

### Show tenant services after project creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Users can now view attached services after the project creation. We added a Services tab to the tenant control plane where users can see tenant services.

### Enabling meshcloud notifications through slack
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this feature, meshStack can now send the same notifications you get via email to your organization's slack account, for example, notifications 
you should be able to receive are e.g budget alerts, quota limits, new tenant creation, etc.

### Delete deprecated API endpoints
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
All endpoints under "Workflow APIs (deprecated)" as mentioned in the API docs are deleted. 
The same functionality is available under the meshObject API.

### Improves meshObject API description
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Adds missing HTTP statuses to the API description.
Improves error messages for rare exceptions during meshObject imports.

### Improved performance during metering service startup
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes a condition that could lead to degraded performance shortly
after metering service startup.

### Enable next button in project creation for optional services
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you created a project and decided for a tenant and landing zone with only optional configurable services, the next button was disabled. This has been fixed.

### Missing groups in identity sync
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When syncing group members from LDAP some groups could be skipped when filtering for specific groups was configured.

### Empty option during setup of a service instance
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
In a few cases, the selection of configuration properties of a service instance were not shown. This is fixed.

### Multi-select tags not selectable on project creation
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When creating a meshProject, you could not select any options for a tag of type multi-select. This is fixed.

### Azure Resource Group Subscription ID instant lock
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When you configure the Subscription ID for the first time on the platform control plane under Settings > Config, entering a single character triggers a instant lock of the field. This is fixed.

### Support for meshTenants as Azure Resource Groups
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We introduced the platform type "Azure Resource Groups". This allows to integrate
Azure tenants that follow a legacy convention of having project resources
organized in Resource Groups. 
meshTenants of the platform type "Azure Resource Groups" are represented as Azure
Resource Groups inside a Subscription.

#### How to use
As an admin add a new Azure Resource Group platform. After you added it you need to
click the newly created platform and go to the "Config" section. There you can enter
the replication information. It is similar to the Azure platform. Make sure the principal
you choose has Resource Group write access to the Subscription that should be used as a parent
container for your Resource Groups.
To create tenants you also need a Landing Zone for this new platform. Add a Landing
Zone and enter the desired location for your Resource Group. Now you can create meshTenants 
for this new platform type.

### Select recommended services for landing zones
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Partners and Platform Operators can now select and edit tenant-aware services for their landing zones. Required as well as optional services can be defined for a landing zone. These services will be proposed to the end-user during project creation at the moment. In future these services will also be presented when adding a new tenant or just by booking a new service for a certain tenant on its tenant control plane.

### Filter and sort meshPlatforms
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We added filtering and sorting in the meshPlatforms page in the Admin Area so it is now easier and faster to find the platform that you're looking for.

### Create tenant services during project creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating a new meshProject, you can now select meshMarketplace services that will add predefined resources to your tenants or configure your tenants in a certain way. Based on the selected Landing Zone, certain services are required or optional for the new meshTenant. Accordingly you have to or can configure the services. This allows to e.g. already add a preconfigured networks with on-prem connent or a certain firewall clearance to your meshTenants. It will take some time after meshProject creation until the services have been applied to your tenants, because the tenants have to be created and configured first via the automated replication done by meshStack.

### Fix loading project access requests
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The 'Access Requests' on the project control plane was in a permanent loading state. This has been fixed.

### Renamed Danger Zone to Deletion
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We renamed the Danger Zone to Deletion in the customer, project & tenant control plane, so you can find deletion functionality more easily.

### Search for tenant ID in Deleted Tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now search for the tenant ID of a deleted tenant or a tenant that has been submitted for deletion by navigating to the Admin Area > Platforms > Deleted Tenants.

### Fixed landing zone creation
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the last release, we released a bug that prevents the creation of landing zones. This is now fixed.

### Fix meshTenants deletion state filtering API
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When filtering on meshTenants with an 'ACTIVE' deletion state in the meshStack API, the response included meshTenants that belong to a deleted meshProject. Those tenants should therefore also be deleted and they should not appear in the response. This is fixed now.

### Fix SCIM API group member synchronization failing
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
In some cases the SCIM Group Member synchronization could fail which would result in 
missing addition or removal of group members. This is now fixed.

### Collect unmanaged tenants for GCP
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Unmanaged tenants are now collected and shown in the Admin area
for Google Cloud Platform.

### Prevent duplicate meshTenant import
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When a meshTenant is in pending deletion, you were able to import a second meshTenant of the same platform instance. This is now fixed.

### Fix missing quota section in Tenant Details
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you access the tenant details of a tenant with an existing quota request, the approval section of the requested quota was missing. This is now fixed.

### Fixed access expired error for unassigned projects
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The Platform Access tab on tenant level was shown for customer admins and owners, even though they were not assigned to the project. This lead to an "access expired" error message. As the tab must not be shown at all in that case, the issue is solved now by not showing the Platform Access tab anymore for those users.

### Solved unassigned project not showing in project overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've solved the issue that sometimes unassigned projects are not included in the project overview.

### Fix meshMarketplace access error message
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With the latest release we introduced a bug that lead to a "could not acquire access token" error message
when accessing a meshMarketplace. This error was shown in the notification center at the top right. All screens
were still working without any issues. This error message did not have any effect on functionality. The underlying
issue has been fixed and the error message won't be shown anymore.

#### How to use
When a meshMarketplace meshTenant is accessed the first time after the new release has been deployed, you may once see
an info message in the notification center, that replication is pending for this meshTenant. This does not affect any
functionality and won't be shown anymore when accessing the same meshMarketplace tenant again later on.

### Fix replication for pending deletion tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A bug prevented the proper replication for meshTenants that were in a 
pending deletion state and awaited manual confirmation. This has been fixed.

### Cloud tenant configuration page in project creation wizard
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've separated the landing zone selection from the cloud platforms page during the project creation. The selected cloud platforms can now be configured step by step. If you select a cloud platform then a sub page will be automatically created for the configuration. Additional configuration options will be added to the new sub pages soon.

### Add user to project directly after adding to customer
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When adding a user or group to a customer, a dialog will now pop up where you can directly assign this
user or group to all the projects within the customer. You will no longer have to hop into each
individual project to do the assignment of the user or group. Please note that this feature
does not work for environments where the 4-eye principal is enabled.

### Extended API docs with new endpoints
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the latest releases, we added endpoints for getting a single meshUser, a list of meshCustomerUserGroups, and 
a single meshCustomerUserGroup.
These endpoints were missing from the API documentation and have now been added.

### Approve deletion of tenants instead of projects
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With the support of the deletion of a single meshTenant, you can now approve the deletion per platform instead of an entire project. By navigating to meshPlatforms > Deleted Tenants,
you'll get an overview over all deleted meshTenants as well as meshTenants requiring your approval. By default, the meshTenants requiring your approval will appear at the top, so you can start with your actions right away.

### Support for single meshTenant deletion
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, you can only remove single meshTenants of the platform OpenStack or Cloud Foundry. For other platforms,
you have to delete entire project in order to remove the meshTenant.
With this new functionality, you can now request the deletion of any meshTenant regardless of their platform.
After a meshTenant is deleted successfully (either automatically or by a manual deletion process), you can recreate a new meshTenant for the 
same meshProject on that platform.

### Expose deletedOn date for meshTenants via meshObject API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The deletedOn flag is set if the meshTenant submitted for deletion. Deleted tenants
can also now be requested via the meshObject API, please see the API docs for more
information.

### Deleted meshTenants are removed from overview list
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A bug showed tenants that belonged to deleted projects in the tenant overview list in the
admin panel. Deleted tenants are now no longer be shown there.

### Get a notification when a tenant requires manual deletion
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
If you want to get notified whenever a tenant is marked for deletion and requires manual deletion, 
you can sign up for an email notification. Please let us know at support@meshcloud.io, which platform 
you want to receive notifications for, as this process is currently not automated. 
You can also get notified for all platforms.

### meshCustomerUserGroup GET endpoint
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
meshCustomerUserGroups can be retrieved via the API. A list of all meshCustomerUserGroups as well as getting a single
meshCustomerUserGroup is supported.

#### How to use
The new API endpoints are described in the API Docs that is provided with a meshStack installation.
Click 'API Docs' at the bottom of the meshPanel to navigate there.

### Visual feedback during successful operations
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have improved the visual feedback during creation and deletion operations. You'll get now a visual toast message at the bottom right if you create or delete a meshCustomer, meshProject, or meshTenant.
We are planning on adding more of these messages in the future.

### Fixed showing duplicate projects
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've solved an issue regarding the project overview. Previously it could be the case that one assigned project occurred two times. This is no longer the case.

### Fix projects overview flickering effect
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The navigation between different customers produced a flicker effect within the projects overview list. We fixed this now and this navigation does no longer produce a flickering effect.

### Show review and create screen for project creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
At the end of the project creation wizard, we now show a "Review and Create" screen. This provides the user with the option to review all project settings again before creating a project.

### Improve IDP user lookup fallback
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Usually multiple sources are used when a user lookup is performed in the panel.
This fixes a bug that prevented the fallback to other sources in case one of the
sources returned an error.

### Filter meshUsers in API based on user attributes
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to filter meshUsers in the API based on attributes like email, firstName, lastName, and more.

### Changing Azure principal passwords has direct effect
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the changing of the Azure Service Principal password in the
platform configuration to take immediate effect (only a service restart fixed the issue before).
When you now change an Azure Service Principal password, the change will be applied immediately.

### Fix generation of environmental reports
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Environmental reports for GCP showing CO2 emission had not been generated recently.
This is fixed now and the environmental reports will be generated once the carbon data
is available in GCP. This is usually the case after ?? 2 weeks into the next month.

### Fixes user deletion for assigned users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When deleting a user who is still assigned to one or more customers,
the deletion of this user failed. This has been fixed now and users 
can be deleted successfully again.

### Failing user deletion for non-customer users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Fixes a bug that prevented the user deletion if the user was not
a member of a customer anymore. It also fixes an issue that could
prevent the user deletion if a Cloud Foundry or OpenStack platform
config was removed in which the user was replicated before.

### Retrieve a single meshUser by their username in the API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to retrieve a single meshUser in the API by specifying their username through a new endpoint.

### Postman collection and openAPI docs for our APIs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
New documentation is now generated including the generation of a Postman collection and openAPI documentation.
These new documentation artifacts can be found on the API Docs page. The new Postman collection has 
a configurable hostname as a variable, so you only have to set your specific hostname once to use it in all requests.

#### How to use
Import the Postman collection in Postman. Configure the authorization in the "Authorization". Set the hostname 
variable. Execute the request.

### Improved error handling on initial tenant replication
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Because of the eventual-consistent behavior of cloud platforms, 
during the initial tenant replication an error was displayed in some cases. 
Those errors usually resolve on their own after some time passes 
and the cloud platform consolidates.
Those initial false-positive replication errors now result in a
"replication pending" state if the tenant was created within the last
30 minutes.

#### How to use
An actual failed replication for a new tenant will therefore be shown as
failed after 30 minutes. But when looking into the tenant replication details
in the admin area you can already see detailed error messages for the different 
steps within the first 30 minutes.

### Fix platform usage report view not loading
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When navigating to one of the platform financials in the Admin Area, in some cases, there was a bug that broke
loading a platform's usage reports. This is now fixed.

### Fix Marketplace charts high service instance count
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When you navigate to a tenant control plane of a marketplace tenant with more than 50 service instances, the service instance and the service binding charts showed wrong numbers. This is fixed now.

### Add report period to meshChargeback line items in API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When retrieving meshChargebacks via the meshObject API, the report period for every line item
is now also included in the response. meshChargebacks can contain line items from different
reporting periods. If for some reason a usage report was not finalized before the related chargeback 
period ended, it will be added to a later chargeback statement once it is finalized.

### Fix resetting optional platform configs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Resetting an optional platform config value (e.g. the carbon footprint config in GCP metering) did
not completely reset the field and lead to some extensive internal logging. This was fixed.

### Include roles assigned via group in navigation bar
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now include roles assigned via groups in the customer roles displayed in the navigation bar.
Previously, only roles directly assigned to your user were visible.

### Hide Cloud Foundry Domains tab when not using Cloud Foundry
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We hide the Cloud Foundry Domains tab when an organization does not use CloudFoundry.

### Show more clearer empty state when not part of any project
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When a user is not part of any project we show a more detailed empty state with a clear call to action.

### Allow GCP tenants with member size > 200
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
A bug prevented the successful replication of GCP tenants with more than
200 project members.

### Purge stuck service instances
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
It is now possible for service owners to purge service instances that have the 'In progress' status.
In some cases it might be easier to purge the service instance rather than fixing the issue in the broker and this is now possible.

#### How to use
In the meshCustomer that owns the service broker, navigate to Marketplace -> Failed Instances.
In this overview, you now see all service instances that are in progress as well.

### Make declarative meshObject comparison case-insensitive
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When importing a meshObject for a second time with a different casing in one of its identifying properties, this 
meshObject (e.g. a meshCustomerGroupBinding) was removed and created again, even-though it was basically the same 
meshObject. This behavior has been fixed now and the comparison of whether the meshObject already exists is 
case-insensitive now. It won't lead to deletion and recreation of the meshObject anymore.

### Fix missing chargeback statements for Controller users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes the issue where users with the Controller role were unable to list and access chargeback statements in the administration area.

### Improve navigation bar responsiveness for mobile devices
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've introduced with the last release the profile preview at the top right for the currently logged in user. Only the responsive behavior for desktop users were covered. Therefore we've adapted the handling to support also the expected behavior for mobile devices.

### Project creation is no longer a dialog
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've moved the project creation to a separate route to unify the look and feel between customer and project creation.

### Support for GCP Carbon Model version 5
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
GCP updated their carbon footprint model to new version 5.
With this change, meshStack is now capable to handle carbon footprint data from both, version 4 and version 5.
However, please make sure to only use items from one model version in the configured BigQuery table.

### Display multiple user roles
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now display the number of additional user roles in a badge on the navigation bar at the top right and show all the assigned roles when hovering over it.

### Removed duplicate small hint fields
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've improved the project name and project identifier field hints
during the project creation. Previously, the hint of each field was
displayed twice: above the input and in the alert. Now the hint will
only be displayed if the input doesn't match the configured pattern.

### API to get Chargeback Statements and Usage Reports
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now get Chargeback Statements and Tenant Usage Reports via the meshObject API of meshMetering.
This will enable smooth integration into financial processes and enables Cloud Foundation teams to use 
this data in BI tools to build custom charts and dashboards.

#### How to use
Please contact <a href="mailto:support@meshcloud.io">meshcloud Support</a> to configure an API user for 
you to use these new APIs.
You will also get the API endpoint and link to the API docs from 
<a href="mailto:support@meshcloud.io">meshcloud Support</a>.

### Show username and customer role at the top right
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To make it clearer as to which user you are logged in as (and in which role) we added this information at the top right of the meshPanel.

### New chart look and feel
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To provide a better look and feel of charts in the meshPanel, we have introduced a new charting library. You can find the first migrated chart on the payment method details page, either in the meshCustomer area or in the Admin area.

### Fix panel not rendering with private platform instance
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the panel from rendering if a meshProject exists
with a meshTenant of a private platform instance to which the current logged
in user has no access.

### Seamless rollover of budgets between periods
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When Chargeback Statements are generated meshStack so far used the latest metadata like
payment information or project tags from the tenant. This has been changed now so for
chargeback statements the tenant data that was set at the end of the month of the chargeback statement period
will be used. This enables, if e.g. payment methods are rolled at the beginning of a new year
and chargeback statements for december are created a few days later, we are still using the payment info
that was set end of december before rolling the payment method.

### Extend list of proposed platform tag values
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the platform config tabs, "customerIdentifier" and "projectIdentifier" are now also available for 
selection when defining the mapping of attributes that shall be used for tenant tagging.

### Hide > 2 meshTags in customer & project control plane
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To create more overview for heavy tag users, we will now hide all meshTags beyond the first two.
You can still see all tags by clicking the small button on the right side of the tags.
Additionally, some meshTags have become clickable now in the meshPanel and will immediately take you to the edit page.

### More information visible for Controllers
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
Users with the Admin Area role "Controller" can now list and edit Payment Methods, see the Chargeback Statements and see the Usage Reports.

### Partial availability when service is down
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the rare case that one of the meshStack services in the background becomes unavailable, meshStack will now partially keep running.
Only functionality dependent on this service will become unavailable, such as replication and cost information, but other functionality will keep working.
Previously, all of meshStack would be unusable.

### Fix empty AWS Savings Plan and Reserved Instances collection
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
If Savings Plans and Reserved Instances collection is activated for an AWS platform, AWS returns a
DataUnavailableException if no Savings Plans or Reserved Instances exist. This is now fixed in meshMetering
so collection also succeeds in this case.

### Show users not assigned to any meshCustomer
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The 'All Users' list in the administration area now shows all users, even the ones that have not been assigned to any meshCustomer(s) yet. Previously only users that were assigned to at least one meshCustomer have be shown.

### Fix project deletion link on tenant control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Deleting tenants is only available for a few platforms. For other platforms, you need to delete the whole project. This information is shown in the info box with a link to the 'Danger Zone' of the project control plane. The link to the 'Danger Zone' was broken and now fixed.

### Added the possibility to change the logo in self-service
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
There is a new screen that allows to change the logo on the top-left in self-service.

#### How to use
Partner Admins and Partner Employees can access this feature in the ADMIN AREA via "meshStack Settings" and "Change Logo".

### Support multi-value tags in payment method CSV export
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the last release we introduced a new payment method CSV export. Unfortunately, this export would not work for for tags with multiple values.
This is now changed and the CSV export for payment methods can handle these tags.

### Fix OpenShift labels starting with an illegal character
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
OpenShift label values starting with an illegal character such as '#' were not sanitized. This resulted in a failed replication.
This is now fixed and any illegal characters at the beginning of an OpenShift label value are stripped.

### Carbon Footprint Reports for GCP
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We introduce new Tenant Usage Reports dedicated to show environmental impact. These
show the carbon footprint data as reported by the cloud provider. Currently this is only
available for GCP meshTenants. There is a new page for environmental reports in the 
admin area as well as a new tab on the meshTenant control plane. You can configure the 
export of environmental data within the GCP meshPlatform settings.

### Fixes duplicate budget alerts notifications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When a limited payment methods budget was exceeded the same payment 
method was mentioned multiple times in the resulting notification email. 
This was fixed.

### Fix panel URL in budget alert & tenant creation e-mails
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
For e-mails sent from the notification service (budget alerts & tenant creation events), the 'Open meshPanel' button was not working.
This is now fixed and the 'Open meshPanel' button will directly open the meshPanel.

### Subscription creation with too long names no longer stuck
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Creations of Subscriptions with a name longer than 64 characters were stuck in a pending replication loop.
The error handling was improved and a proper error message is now returned with the replication
state failed.

### Export payment method usage as CSV
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the admin area, you can find a list of all payment methods including their consumption
and percentage used towards their limits. To provide you with better accounting and
integration capabilities we have now made this list exportable as a CSV file. You
can find the 'Export' button on the top-right of the payment methods page.

### Better readable tooltips
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The various tooltips available via the small questionmark in the meshPanel have been made more readable
by making them wider and providing a black text on white background. Some of the text in these tooltips
have also been improved. We will work on adding more helpful tooltips in the meshPanel in the near future.

### Removes notifications for deleted/expired payment methods
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Budget alerts are not send out anymore for deleted or expired payment methods.

### Fix metering data not processing in OpenStack
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
We removed a bug in the OpenStack metering process
that was originally introduced with v7.121.0 and left 
some metering data unprocessed. With the current fix
OpenStack metering data will be handled correctly again.

### Fix Azure role mappings in meshPlatform settings
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
This change repairs the form for Azure meshPlatform settings.
Previously, the fields for the Azure Role Definition ID and Azure Group Suffix were mixed up.

### Performance improvement for notification service
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
During high-frequency user updates, the notification service consumed too many 
resources as the database queries were inefficient. This slowed down the application. 
We have now optimized the database queries which in turn has improved the user update process significantly.
We also fixed a broken database query that failed to properly query the payment method usage amount.
This prevented sending out warning notifications if the 80% usage threshold was reached.

### Include empty Azure meshTenants in Chargeback
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Recently, a bug was introduced while improving the Azure Metering collection. This bug prevented generation
and finalization of Tenant Usage Reports for Azure meshTenants which have no resources and no consumption at all.
Tenant or Landing Zone Fees should usually be applied to these Azure meshTenants, as these meshTenants still exist.

#### How to use
We have fixed the bug. Now the May 2022 Tenant Usage Reports will be generated again and finalized. As Chargeback
Statements for May 2022 have already been created, these Usage Reports will be put into the June 2022 Chargeback Statements automatically.
Hence, you will see Usage Reports for these empty Azure meshTenants for May and June 2022 in the Chargeback Statement for June 2022.

### Restrict customer creation if external registration set
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
If meshStack was configured to redirect to an external system for customer creation, all Partner 
users (users with access to the Admin Area) were allowed to create a new meshCustomer within meshStack.
Now, only Partner Admins can create a new meshCustomer.

### Automatic trim when adding tag values to a selection
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When you provide multiple selectable tag values for your tag, your values are automatically trimmed.

### Fixes a bug in User Deletion
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Deleting users with EUID creates an entry with a sha256 hashed EUID. While EUIDs
should be unique, this has created a problem of duplicate EUIDs when a user is
created, deleted, created and then deleted again.

With this fix a unix timestamp is assigned to the generated EUID, which makes the EUID unique.

### Chargeback Statement Previews
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
meshStack now generates a preview chargeback statement for the current period. 
This preview includes all tenant usage reports that meshStack expects to be finalized and included in the final
chargeback statement of the current period.

#### How to use
Like tenant usage reports, preview statements are flagged as "not finalized" for screens that are already showing chargeback statements. Chargeback preview can help cloudfoundation stakeholders to ensure data quality.
Customer administrators and customer owners can find chargeback statements for their meshProjects in the project control plane -> Financials.
Operators can find chargeback previews in the admin area -> Chargeback Statements. Operators can optionally filter the table by period and export chargeback statements, including non-finalized statements to CSV for further processing.
For more information about chargeback statements, please refer to the documentation.

### Azure cost item collection improvements
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
This change fixes multiple issues with the Azure cost item collection feature. A new aggregation mode significantly 
speeds up the collection progress (as a result of this the Azure related usage reports are more compact now).
In certain environments the Azure API was not responding as expected and missed 
required properties. That has led to collection failures or incomplete collections for certain subscriptions. 
Removing the need for this property enables successful collection again.

### Fixes edge-case in customer deletion
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In some cases, if users that never really used meshStack were assigned to a meshCustomer, 
deletion of the meshCustomer cases failed. This issue is now resolved.

### Carbon Footprint data for GCP
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
It is now possible for GCP platforms to export carbon footprint data.
This data will appear on Tenant Usage Reports and inform about the relevant costs in terms of 
CO2 equivalents. (kgCO2e) You can enable this by exporting the carbon footprint data into BigQuery
within GCP by following this guide: https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint/docs/export
Afterwards you can enable this for meshStack by configuring the "BigQuery Table For CO2e" in
the respective platform configuration settings.

### Sanitize slashes in OpenShift labels
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
OpenShift only supports a certain subset of characters for label keys and values. In some cases, slashes are not supported.
The rules that are applied to sanitize slashes have been improved in meshStack so only labels that are accepted by OpenShift are replicated.
Additionally, error messages shown to operators for failed tag replications have been extended to provide more
details in cases like these.

### Load optimization on the notification service
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In order to optimize the load on the notification service we reduced the user sync interval.
Changes to user and customer assignments that affect notification receptions will now take up
to 24h to have an effect.

### Fixed static tag values in meshPlatform config
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to provide tags with a fixed string value within the
meshPlatform configuration. Those tags values do not contain a placeholder
for replacement during replication, such as "${customerName}". 
Tag sanitization is still applied.

### Fix policy violations not available after adding yourself
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
If you appeared in the policy violations and you use the "Remove Myself" in the Admin Area, the policy violations in the Admin area and the customer control plane would not load for an amount of time. This has been fixed and the policy violations will work right away again.

### Fix tenant filtering not working for customer & project
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the last release, the filtering and sorting on the customer & project column in the tenants view in the Admin Area stopped working.
This is now fixed and the sorting and filtering on all columns works again.

### Added filtering on Tenant Id in Tenant View
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
To make it easier to find the right tenant, you can now apply a filter for the "Tenant Id" column in the
Admin Area -> Tenant List.

### Remove yourself from meshCustomers
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Users with Customer Owner or Customer Admin role can now remove a binding to a meshCustomer that affects themselves. 
This is possible if either another binding (user or group) with the same role still exists or a binding 
as Customer Owner / Customer Admin remains.

### Fixes missing variables for payment notifications
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
This fixes some broken mail template variables, that were missing in the generated
notification email.

### Tags of type string indicate active meshPolicies
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Just like multi-select and single-select tags: if a tag is of type string and involved in meshPolicies, it is now indicated in the panel.

### Policies are enforced during tenant assignment
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When having a policy on meshLandingZone, the landing zone selection disables landing zones that do not comply with the active policy. This ensures that users will only pick the right landing zones that comply with the policy.

### Improve filtering and sorting in landing zone table
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
The recently introduced landing zone filtering and sorting feature has been improved. When opening the page,
the 'name' field will be used as default sort. This prevents results being random every time a page is loaded.
Additionally, the tags & meshPlatform columns did not support sorting, but the arrow buttons appeared.
This is fixed now and the arrow buttons do not appear anymore.

### Prevent tag deletion if policies are active
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have improved the tag deletion process. You can now delete a tag only if there are no meshPolicies defined for it.

### Explanation why 'Add Myself' fails in Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
If you add yourself via the 'Add Myself' button to a customer in the Admin Area and your tags are not compliant with the customers, an error will be displayed stating the detailed reason.

### Notification upon tenant creation
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to receive notifications for newly created cloud tenants. These notifications will be sent out via e-mail.
In order to configure this feature, please get in touch with us at support@meshcloud.io. Please keep in mind that this is a beta
feature for now. In the future, we plan on including notification configuration in the meshPanel.

### Notifications for soon to be exceeded payment methods
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A notification has been introduced that warns customer users if one or more payment methods have been used up over 
90% of their limit. If this happens, all customer admins of the customer receive an e-mail notification. 
This notification was built by introducing a new and powerful notification service in meshStack. This same service 
will be used to bring more useful notification capabilities into meshStack. Let us know at 
https://meshcloud.canny.io/ if you have any other ideas for useful notifications!

### Policies are enforced during project access control
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When having a policy between meshProject -> meshUser/Group, the project access control lookup will now hide users that do not comply with the active policy. This will ensure that users will only pick the right users/groups that comply with the policy.

### New platform icons of Azure & Google Cloud
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The platform icons for Azure & Google Cloud have been updated to their new versions

### Policies are enfocred during customer access control
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When having a policy on meshUser/Group, the access control lookup will now hide users that do not comply with the active policy. This will ensure that users will only pick the right users/groups that comply with the policy.

### Fix OpenShift tenant creation sometimes failing tagging step
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When initially creating a new OpenShift project, the tenant replication process would sometimes fail the "Tag Project" step.

### Fix payment method list not working for German characters
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Sometimes it could be the case that the payment methods can't be loaded because of some German character issues. This is now fixed.

### Fixed payment method preselection
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Sometimes it could be the case that a project has no payment method assigned. Previously the project control plane preselected the first available payment method but this payment method wasn't applied. Now we removed this behavior to improve the UX and transparency regarding the payment methods.

### Prevent creation of payment method with backslash character
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Creating payment methods with an identifier with a backslash '\' is no longer supported to prevent issues
when opening the payment method in the meshPanel.

### Platform Configuration for Kubernetes & ASK via meshPanel
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
All configuration required for Kubernetes and Azure Kubernetes Service replication 
and metering can now be done via meshPanel.

#### How to use
Go to the Platform Control Plane of the meshPlatform you want to configure and navigate to "Settings" -> "Config".
Now you can enter all configuration options including the secrets needed for meshStack to access the platform.

### Platform Configuration for Azure via meshPanel
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
All configuration required for Azure replication and metering can now be done via meshPanel.
More platform types will follow soon.

#### How to use
Go to the Platform Control Plane of the meshPlatform you want to configure and navigate to "Settings" -> "Config".
Now you can enter all configuration options including the secrets needed for meshStack to access the platform.

### Optimized performance for policy checks
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
New optimizations will reduce the load on the database
and improve general application performance.

### Applying changes to previous tag settings
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously the tag catalogue in the "Administration Area" didn't show the currently applied configurations for some tags. Now the configuration is shown and changes can be applied to all or some of the values during edit.

### Platform Configuration for GCP via meshPanel
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
All configuration required for GCP replication and metering can now be done via meshPanel.
More platform types will follow soon.

#### How to use
Go to the Platform Control Plane of the meshPlatform you want to configure and navigate to "Settings" -> "Config".
Now you can enter all configuration options including the secrets needed for meshStack to access the platform.

### Platform Configuration for AWS via meshPanel
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
All configuration required for AWS replication and metering can now be done via meshPanel.
More platform types will follow soon.

#### How to use
Go to the Platform Control Plane of the meshPlatform you want to configure and navigate to "Settings" -> "Config".
Now you can enter all configuration options including the secrets needed for meshStack to access the platform.

### IdentityConnector cleans up groups
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When extracting user information from LDAP via the optional IdentityConnector
component, the generated meshObjects are put into collections. That enables
an automatic cleanup if the LDAP source does not list those relations anymore.

### Openshift support for self-service tags
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The platform integration of meshStack into Openshift now supports the modern tagging system that is similar
to the one for AWS, Azure & GCP. This means that administrators can now tick the 'Enable replication' checkbox
and all Openshift projects will be tagged on the next replication run.
We also improved the default tags of Openshift: all resources managed by meshStack are now tagged with `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: meshStack`,
`meshstack.yourcompany.com: $customerIdentifier` and `meshstack.yourcompany.com: $projectIdentifier`.

### Fix payment method identifier with slash breaking panel
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
For legacy payment methods that have a forward slash (/) in the identifier, the detail page of these payment methods could not be opened
in the meshPanel. This is now fixed and the details of the payment method can be seen again.

### Add Platform Identifier uniqueness check
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Added a check to make sure platform full identifiers are unique when creating a new meshPlatform.
This uniqueness check also considers deactivated meshPlatforms as they might be reactivated 
again.

### Prevent selection of global location for new meshPlatforms
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is no longer possible to select the global location as target when
creating new meshPlatforms via the meshPanel. The global location is
meant only for the global marketplace.

### Prefiltered meshProject tag values
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
meshProject tag values are now prefiltered if meshPolicies are active. This simplifies
the tag value selection by having invalid options disabled. Additionally, you can hover
over the shield next to the tag to see which meshSubjects are involved in the policies.
To get more insights, you can click on the shield to get to the list of existing policies.

### Users with empty EUID don't break Azure replication
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
A user that had an empty EUID set prevented a successful Azure project replication.
These users are now filtered and will not be considered for replication until a proper EUID
is set. Usually this happens if the user logs into the panel or the user is imported via the
meshObject API with a proper, non-empty EUID.

### Platform Configuration for OpenShift via meshPanel
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
All configuration required for OpenShift replication and metering can now be done via meshPanel.
Other platform types will follow soon.

#### How to use
Go to the Platform Control Plane of the meshPlatform you want to configure and navigate to "Settings" -> "Config".
Now you can enter all configuration options including the secrets needed for meshStack to access the platform.

### Log statement improvements
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Numerous exceptions were logged without including the response body in case
of a failed API request to remote systems. This bug was fixed and those response
body contents will now be included in the system message for a failed tenant
replication.

### Landing Zone description visible in dropdown
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When adding a new tenant to a project, the landing zone description is now also visible in the dropdown itself.
This should make it easier and faster to pick the right landing zone for your project.

### Add an optional fixing hint to your policy
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
As a partner, you can now provide an optional fixing hint to your policy when you create or edit a policy. This helps users understand how they can resolve the situation when they violate a policy.

### Add an optional description to your policy
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
As a partner, you can now provide an optional description in your policy when you create or edit a policy. This helps users understand the intention of your policy.
Find all policies and their description, either in the Admin Area under Compliance > Policies or on the customer control plane under Compliance > Active Policies.

### Policy violations will be regenerated
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We're currently improving the policy violations transparency. Therefore it is necessary to cleanup the existing policy violations. It could be the case that the policy violations are temporarily not available. The policy violations will be regenerated. No further actions are required.

### Fixes race condition in Azure authentication logic
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes an issue caused by parallel and long-running API requests against 
the Azure API. That could lead to sporadic failures due to a faulty 
authentication token refresh.

### Directly navigate to external payment method request page
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
For those that use an external process to request a payment method in meshStack, it is now possible to
configure a URL that will link from the meshCustomer's payment method page to an external link.
This will make it easier for users to find the right payment method request processes.
Get in touch with us to configure this new option.

### Improved permission handling for Azure UAMI Blueprints
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The logic behind the assignment of the user-assigned managed identities during
the initial assignment or update of a Blueprint was improved. Previously, roles 
could have been removed too early in case multiple Blueprints would use the same 
identity. That could lead to permissions issues with the second Blueprint assignment.

### Configurable policy evaluation strategy
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to configure a specific evaluation strategy for each policy. Currently, we support the strategies 'subset' and 'intersection'. To learn more about how each strategy works, take a look into the meshPolicies documentation https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshcloud.policies.html.

### Fixed unreadable error reason during access control
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Sometimes an unreadable "[object Object]" error reason occurs when assigning users or groups to meshCustomers and meshProjects. This is now fixed.

### Policies are now one-way to make them easier to use
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The relationship between two policy subjects within a meshPolicy is no longer
bidirectional. Every meshPolicy describes a relation into one specific direction.
This means for example if you want to restrict the meshProject depending on a
meshCustomer then you need to define the following meshPolicy: meshCustomer ->
meshProject. This is the first step to increase the readability of the policies and
policy violations. Be aware that we'll incrementally release more and more
improvements in the coming weeks. For more information please take a look into the documentation https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshcloud.policies.html .

### Fixes a deployment issue
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Resolves a small deployment issue.

### Customer roles no longer selectable for Partners
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
To prevent confusion on which role(s) to pick for your partner users, the Customer roles (Owner, Admin & Employee)
have been removed from the Partner Access Control page. This page will now only show Partner-related roles.

### No longer show outdated unmanaged tenants
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Unmanaged tenants are useful to get an overview of all the tenants not yet under your management in meshStack.
However, when deleting this tenant in the cloud platform, meshStack did not recognize the deletion and the
unmanaged tenant would stay around indefinitely. This is now fixed and after not observering the cloud tenant
for three days, the unmanaged tenant will be deleted.

### Unified Role Mappings in Landing Zones
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Defining role mappings for Landing Zones is now unified on a top-level. The same validations are 
executed and the same header and general description are used for all platform types. 
This unification is also a preparation for the upcoming Platform Connection
Configuration where those Role Mappings will be available too.

### Autofill e-mail when inviting a new user
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When looking up a new user via their e-mail address in the access control tab,
you might be prompted to invite that new user. If you entered a valid e-mail, it
will automatically be filled in the opened modal.

### Fixes meshCustomerUserBinding validation
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When assigning Customer Owners via the meshObject API, and already having customer owners assigned, 
the API could throw an error when trying to assign the same customer owners again as they were not
considered the same users. This is now fixed and if you try to assign the same customer owners 
(as intended with a declarative API), the API will not throw any errors anymore.

### Immutable tags
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The idea of immutable tags is that we allow the selection of specific tag values
during the creation process. Afterwards it is no longer possible to edit the selected
values. For example if you create a meshProject with environment tag 'dev' then you can't
change the meshProject to 'prod' after creation. If you want a meshProject with
environment tag 'prod' you need to create a new meshProject.

### Instantly edit first-time tags
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When creating your first customer or project tag as a partner, a panel refresh
was required to make this tag show up either via the customer creation wizard
or via the tag editing capabilities in the admin area. This is now fixed
and the panel will show the newly created tag without requiring a panel refresh.

### Auto-close after selecting single-select tag value
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when selecting a single-select tag value, the dropdown would not 
close automatically but required an extra click somewhere else on the page.
This is now no longer the case and the dropdown will close automatically
after selecting a value.

### Prevent logo overflow in navigation bar
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In some environments, a large panel logo results in an overflowing navigation bar that hides some important "Go back", "Refresh" or "Create" buttons. This has been fixed.

### Danger Zone tab moved to main tabs on control planes
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Users can now easily find the deletion functionality called "Danger Zone" on the main tabs of control planes, 
which was previously under the "Settings" tab. Thank you for providing your feedback on the new control planes!

### Improvement for AWS Account Enrollment
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The identification of existing AWS Provisioned Products during the Account Enrollment process
for AWS Control Tower was not always working properly for meshTenants, that have been imported
via the meshObject API. This has now been corrected.

### Deactivate/Reactive meshPlatforms
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to deactivate and reactivate meshPlatforms via the "Danger Zone" tab in the
Platform Control Plane of the Admin Area.

#### How to use
Deactivation will make the meshPlatform not available anymore
to new meshTenants and existing meshTenants won't be accessible via meshPanel anymore and no more replication
will be executed. Metering instead will still be executed for non-deleted meshTenants of this meshPlatform for now. This
will change in future. Direct access in the cloud platform itself to the platform tenants is still possible as meshStack
does not delete or do any updates on platform tenants when a meshPlatform is deactivated. A reactivation
of meshPlatforms is also possible. This will allow reaccessing non-deleted meshTenants of this meshPlatform again
and make the meshPlatform available again for new meshTenants.

### Improve error message when importing meshTenant
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When you import a meshTenant with a localId which is already assigned to another meshTenant on the same platform, you will receive a hint in the response that you can't set that localId because it is in use.

### Fix meshProject import ignoring updated tags
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The declarative import of a meshProject in the meshObject API would ignore updated tags for an existing project.
This is now fixed and any updated tags of a meshProject will be applied correctly.

### Option to restrict meshPlatforms during creation
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to restrict meshPlatforms to certain meshCustomers already when creating new meshPlatforms.

#### How to use
This allows you to e.g. restrict new meshPlatforms initially to a meshCustomer you own as a Platform Operator.
You can test whether all integrations are working as expected and make the instance public once you are done.
Or you could restrict a dedicated meshPlatform from the beginning on to certain meshCustomers.

### Edit meshProvider Info
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to edit meshProvider information via the "Settings -> Provider" tab
in the Platform Control Plane.

### Fix validation on required 'Multi Select' tags
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
We fixed a problem around the selection of required tags. The problem only applied when a required tag provided multiple selectable options in a multi-select manner. It was possible to circumvent the required setting and leave the tag empty.

### Multiple meshPolicyRules are no longer supported
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
We've removed the possibility to assign multiple meshPolicyRules to one meshPolicy. Each meshPolicy has exactly one specific tag mapping. For more information please take a look into the docs https://docs.dev.meshcloud.io/docs/meshcloud.policies.html#introduction-what-are-meshpolicies .

### Customers can not have more than 250 active payment methods
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The creation of payment methods through the panel and meshObjectImport is restricted if already 250 active payment methods
are present in a given customer. Get in touch with us if you are experiencing problems because of this limitation.

### Increased flexibility for fees and discounts
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The discount and fee model has been extended by a new rule.
The new rule determines a tier based on the consumption.
Depending on the consumption tier a specified amount is added (fee) or deducted (discount) from the tenant usage report and chargeback statement.
See https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.billing-configuration.html for further information.

#### How to use
Contact your Service Manager.

### No more duplicate icons in tenant replication steps
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When a tenant replication step is successful and has a remark, the panel showed both a 'Success' and a 'Info' icon.
This is no longer the case and the panel will now only shown an 'Info' icon in this case.

### Fixed edge case in platform restriction
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If a meshLocation contained more than 1 meshPlatform and only some of the meshPlatforms within the
meshLocation were private, they were shown for selection when creating a new meshTenant. When actually trying to
create the meshTenant an error was shown to the user, that the platform is not available for the given meshCustomer.
With the fix these restricted meshPlatforms are not listed as an option for a new meshTenant anymore if the meshCustomer
does not have access to the meshPlatform.

### Adds proxy auth to the GCP Cloud Function call
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The client responsible for invoking a GCP Cloud Function does now
respect proxy authentication config.

### Make clear that navigation bar button is a feedback button
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The button at the top of the meshPanel now explicitly mentions "Feedback" next to the button to make
clear that it is meant for providing product feedback.

### Edit meshLocation Info
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to edit meshLocation display name and description via the "Settings -> Location" tab
in the Platform Control Plane.

### Allow dashes in GCP label keys
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Tagging across multiple clouds is challenging because restrictions on supported characters differ across cloud providers. 
meshStack sanitizes keys and values of tags before replicating them to the clouds. With this release, meshStack added the `-` to the supported characters for GCP label keys.
This means the label key `my-project` will from now on be replicated as `my-project` and not as `my_project`.

### View all payment methods if customers have more than 50
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
As a Partner, you have not been able to list some of the payment methods 
of a customer in the panel, if the customer has more than 50 payment methods. 
This has been fixed.

### Edit General meshPlatform Info
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to edit meshPlatform display name and Web Console Url via the "Settings -> General" tab
in the Platform Control Plane.

### Fix authentication error for high count of projects
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If the number of projects a user had access to exceeded 50, the panel did not
properly signal the user access anymore.

### User deletion picks up all users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The logic around user deletion prevented the deletion of some users via panel. This bug has been fixed. Partners can now delete all users that are shown in the all users list of the admin area.

### Remove deprecated default labels on GCP projects
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
During GCP project creation two labels (mesh-customer and mesh-project) were set on the project  
that were not related to the tag management system and thus never updated.
The creation of those two tags has been removed. However, we won't delete those tags automatically
as some customers might rely on them. You can manually delete them in GCP if they are not needed anymore.
If GCP labels are required that contain the meshCustomerIdentfier or meshProjectIdentfier, those tags
can be configured via the tag replication system (currently not via self-service, please contact us for
this configuration change at support@meshcloud.io).

### Introduce Platform Control Plane
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
A Platform Control Plane has been introduced in the Admin Area to maintain and manage a meshPlatform. So far all
functionality that was covered under the meshPlatforms section in the Admin Area moved there. The action buttons on
the meshPlatforms list have been replaced by the Control Plane.

#### How to use
The Platform Control Plane can be accessed via the link in the meshPlatform name in the meshPlatform list. It contains
editing of Platform Quota Definitions, getting Platform Usage Reports and restricting platforms to certain customers 
via the "Settings" tab. Editing platform, location and provider information will follow soon. In future also meshLandingZones,
meshTenants and Platform Notifications will move to this new Platform Control Plane.

### Visual improvement of meshPlatform list
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The meshPlatform list in the Admin Area has been visually improved. It now shows one line
per platform instead of grouping platforms by location. The location is now a regular column
in the list and the platform icon is shown next to the meshPlatform name.

### Tenant deletion more stable
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In some rare cases, there was the possibility of a deadlock if a fault occurred during tenant deletion
preventing the re-try from successfully completing.
This deadlock condition was fixed and deleted tenants will now be cleaned up.

### Platform Operator can edit project tags
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
As a platform operator, you could not edit the project tags which is contrary to the statement in the documentation. This has been fixed, you are now able to edit all available tags on any projects.

### Various payment method selection improvements
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
There are a improvements in place now when selecting a payment method,
either when creating a new project or editing an existing project.
You can now search in the list of payment methods based on either
the name, identifier, or tags of the payment method. The tags of
the payment method are now also displayed in their familiar green
bubbles like the rest of the meshPanel.

### meshPlatform creation in self-service
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
New meshPlatforms can now be created via the "Create meshPlatform" button on the meshPlatforms screen
in the Admin Area.

#### How to use
Currently you can provide basic information of the meshPlatform here. Detailed Configuration
of the meshPlatform must be done by meshcloud at the moment. This will also be possible in self-service soon.
What you can achieve with the current functionality is already defining meshLandingZones for the created meshPlatform
or create meshTenants for this meshPlatform. A successful replication or metering of meshTenants can only be
performed if the configuration by meshcloud has been finalized. Editing existing meshPlatforms will be available
soon.

### View all projects when customers have 250+ projects
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
As a Customer Admin, you have not been able to access some of the projects in the panel, if your customer has more than 250 projects. This has been fixed.

### Explicit explanation of customer & project access
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We have learned that some users struggle to understand the two levels of access we have on the meshCustomer &
meshProject level. To make that easier, we added an info box in each access control screen to explain the difference.
This should prevent users from being confused when they are assigned to the customer but do not have platform access.

### Provider Info on Tenant Control Plane
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Some provider info like a link to a support website and a description can be defined for a meshLocation.
This has been shown via an info popover on the tenant list in the Project Control Plane. It is now also
available on the Tenant Control Plane. Additionally the link to the website was missing since the 
Customer Area UI Overhaul. This has been added next to the info popover now.

### Azure landing zones can be changed again
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We've improved the handling how azure role mappings are evaluated within meshPanel's Landing Zone edit screen. Previously it wasn't possible to edit a landing zone because the upcoming error prevented the user from saving changes.

### Improves job scheduling for billing
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Internal task scheduling has been improved and is less reliant on external components.

### Tag overview shows message if no tags are defined
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Within the tag overview section you'll get now the information that no tags are defined. Previously the table was not shown.

### Fix not being able to switch payment methods
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
In environments, where the substitute payment method has been disabled in the config, the active payment methods could not be saved on the project control plane. This has been fixed.

### Handle Rate Limit of Azure Cost Management API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Azure applies a rate limit to requests made to their Cost Management API, which is used by meshMetering.
We improved on how this rate limit is being handled.

### Better Azure Subscription creation error messages
**Audience:** Partner, Customer, User<br>

#### Description
A rare case during Azure Subscription creation which only delayed the creation process 
resulted in a severe sounding error message. This edge case detection was improved and 
the wording of the message was adapted.

### Order of AWS replication steps improved
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Account tagging and account alias checks are now done earlier in an AWS replication
run. This makes it more robust against failures in the IDP step.

### No Chargeback Statements for deleted meshProjects
**Audience:** Customer, Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
In the past, Chargeback Statements have been generated for deleted meshProjects as well. 
With this change we will still generate Chargeback Statements for deleted meshProjects, but 
only for those tenants that have outstanding costs. This might be the case e.g. for a 
meshProject that got deleted during a statement period, but still utilized billable items 
until then. In line with this, we will not create Chargeback Statements for deleted 
meshProjects without billable items anymore.

### meshTenant V2 - Reference landing zone by identifier
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We recently introduced an identifier for landing zones. This makes referencing
landing zones more stable, since changing the name of a landing zone is always possible,
but identifiers cannot be changed. This allows worry-free name changes of landing zones.
To achieve the same benefit for API users, the meshTenant object in the API now has a second
version (V2) which references landing zones by identifiers, instead of their names.
Have a look at the API documentation to see how it works.
At some point in the future we will deprecate the V1 of a meshTenant, which use landing zone
name referencing. We will notify you when this will happen.

### External registration redirect button has no text
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixes the missing text on the redirect button when external registration is used.

### Fix for broken Chargeback Statements links
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The links to go to the Chargeback Statements in the meshPanel 
were broken since version v7.104.0. They have been repaired now.

### Visible role mappings validation in Landing Zone
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When creating or editing role mappings in certain Landing Zones, it was not clear why the save button is not enabled. This has been improved, hints regarding the role mapping validation are now visible.

### Tenant platform number for Cloud Functions and Lambdas
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The previously introduced sequence number for tenants on a platform is now also
exposed for Lambdas/Cloud Functions for AWS, GCP and Azure.

### Improvements for Chargeback Statement generation
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We improved the internal generation of Chargeback Statements
so that it is easier to monitor the process and detect possible
issues.

### Completion of Customer Navigation Overhaul
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
All new and existing functionality for customer, project, and tenant management can now be found in the new control planes. As a final step, all product functionality that became obsolete in the meantime has now been removed. This mainly entails the 'Account Area' and all of its screens.

### Customer Admin can access all projects via navigation bar
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
As a Customer Admin, you can now navigate to all projects via the navigation bar at the top, even if you are not assigned to the project. Besides that we've improved the tenants overview in the project control plane. You can now also see information about the landing zone and replication status as a Customer Admin who is not assigned to the project.

### Show more than 50 payment methods in selection
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
While adding or editing a payment method on the project level, the selection showed a maximum of 50 payment methods in the selection.
In the case of editing the payment method when more than 50 payment methods are present in your meshCustomer, the assigned payment method appeared as not assigned to the project. This is now fixed.

### Fix duplicate user groups showing with multiple bindings
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When a meshCustomerUserGroup has multiple bindings (e.g. Customer Employee & Customer Admin), the 'User Groups'
section in the customer control plane would show the user group twice. This is now fixed and the user group
is only shown once.

### Remove yourself from meshCustomers
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Users with Customer Owner or Customer Admin role can now remove a binding to a meshCustomer for
themselves in case another binding (user or group) with the same role still exists.

### Add new tenants directly in project control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to add a new tenant directly in the list of tenants in the project control plane. This makes it easier to manage your tenants in one place.

### Manage Quotas in the tenant control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
You can now create, update or delete quota requests for your tenants in the tenant control plane by navigating to Settings > Quotas.

### Fix redirect after project deletion
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
In rare cases it could have happened that you were redirected to the not-found screen after deleting a meshProject.
This has been fixed now.

### Introduces sequential tenant number as template placeholder
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously there was no attribute that was guaranteed to increase in sequence for every meshTenant. With the introduction
of this property it is now possible to use this inside string template configuration to access this sequential number in configuration
based strings or lambda functions.
For more information about the string template functions check the documentation under: 
https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.replication-configuration.html#string-templating

### Fix 'Add my groups' position in project creation modal
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
With the recent release we introduced a modal for the project creation workflow.
This change made the position of the 'Add my groups' dropdown in the Project Access Control partially out of view.
This is now fixed and the dropdown is fully visible on the page again.

### Removal of meshTenants via Tenant Control Plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
OpenStack, Cloud Foundry and meshMarketplace tenants can now be removed from a meshProject via the
Settings / Danger-Zone tab in the Tenant Control Plane. The ability to remove these tenants has been removed
from the project edit screen in the Account Area. Support for removing tenants of other platforms
will follow in future.

### Tenant management for unassigned customer admins
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
Customer Admins are now enabled to view and manage tenants in the new control planes, even when not assigned to the project.
Therefore you will get an overview of all existing tenants within the project tenants screen but with less information because an unassigned user can not access the platform. If you do want to access the actual tenant in the cloud platform, make sure to assign yourself a project role.

### Project control plane with Resource Check and Deletion
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
As a Customer Admin, you can now delete your project under 'Settings' in the 'Danger Zone' tab and list your resources in the 'General' tab. The former buttons in overview of projects located in the Account Area will lead you to the according tabs.

### Tenant caching improvement
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We've introduced the tenant control plane during the recent weeks. We now did some improvements in the background as a preparation to also make tenants of projects you are not assigned to accessible via the control planes. As a result of this refactoring you will now also see a loader when the tenant control plane is loading.

### Cleaner project creation flow
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When creating a new project you are no longer redirected to the Account Area, but a modal opens instead.
This makes the project creation flow more focused and reduces distraction from the various menu items in the Account Area.
Additionally, we moved the wizard steps to the left of the screen so they are more easily visible.

### Redirect to new project after creation
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously when creating a new project you would be redirected to the projects overview page.
To make the user experience better and reduce the amount of clicks a user has to take we now
redirect the user immediately to the newly created project.

### Improved Platform Access Navigation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In order to provide a more intuitive structure in the Tenant Platform Access screens, the Tools
section has been removed and all menu items below it can now be found on the top of the menu under
a section that is named like the platform. Additionally the URLs of the screens in that area have
been improved.

### Rename display name of meshProjects
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to rename the display name of your meshProject.
To do so, open the project in the new project control plane and navigate to 'Settings -> General'.
In this screen you will be able to enter a new name and save your changes.

### Prevention of non-existing expiration dates
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Now users can not add invalid or non-existing expiration dates in the payment method form. To prevent wrong dates being set the field will get reset and a valid date can be picked.
when trying to set an invalid date.

### Fix an issue with the deployment
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes an issue that blocks deployment

### New template pattern interfering with config lib
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The parsing of config files by the used configuration library was
causing issues when setting up the latest placeholder templates for e.g. project name 
generation. This was mitigated by changing the placeholder pattern.

### Collapsible content in group detail screen
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When looking at the details of a meshCustomerUserGroup or meshPartnerUserGroup, the various content is now
in collapsible containers. This makes it easier to find the information you are looking for by hiding
some of the data that you are not interested in.
This is especially useful for (global) groups that are assigned to a large number of projects.

### Hide Payment Method tab for customer employees
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
As a Customer Employee, you won't see the 'Payment Method' tab in the project control plane anymore as this is only accessible for Customer Admins.

### Improves logging for Service Broker communication
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
OSB-specific headers added to Service Broker related HTTP requests are now always logged.

### Adding yourself to customer updates navigation bar
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When you add/remove yourself to/from a customer, the customer dropdown in the navigation bar at the top did not contain this customer and required a refresh of your browser. This has been fixed.

### Fix customer owners not seeing replication information
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If you are a Customer Owner you could not see the replication status of your tenants in the project control plane.
This is now fixed.

### Project caching improvement
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We've introduced the project control plane during the recent weeks. We now did some improvements in the background as a preparation to also make tenants of projects you are not assigned to accessible via the control planes. As a result of this refactoring you will now also see a loader when the project control plane is loading.

### Tenant session improvement
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We improved the tenant session handling in the background. If you are still logged in after the new release has been rolled out and detect any unexpected error, please do a page reload in the browser.

### Use multiple billing accounts in GCP billing data collection
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
meshStack collects data from GCP billing export to BigQuery in order to generate usage reports for the GCP platform.
In BigQuery, the billing export is partitioned by a column named '_PARTITIONTIME'. We use this column to limit the
amount of data meshStack reads at a given time to reduce the read costs incurred when collecting data.
Some of our customers have multiple billing accounts associated with a single GCP meshPlatform. This means that
we have to collect data from multiple BigQuery datasets to generate the usage reports for such a meshPlatform.
This can be done by creating a single view in BigQuery which contains the same columns as a GCP billing export
and is a union of all the datasets. But columns that start with an underscore, like _PARTITIONTIME are not allowed
by GCP BigQuery, so this column would have to be mapped to a different name like PARTITIONTIME. Because of this reason
we made a change to meshStack GCP billing component to make the partition column configurable, so that we can successfully
collect billing data from such a 'union' table.
With this change, meshStack is now capable of considering data from multiple billing accounts when generating the usage
reports for a single GCP meshPlatform.

### Pending Access Requests moves to project control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
You can now find the pending access requests for your project under 'Access Control' in the 'Access Requests'-tab.

### Approve Access moves to customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
You can now find all pending access requests for all of your projects under 'Projects' in the 'Access Requests'-tab.

### More informative message on GCP role assignment error
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
During GCP tenant replication, when assigning roles to a newly created group, GCP sometimes responds with an error
"One or more users named in the policy do not belong to a permitted customer.", which resulted previously in a failed
replication with a generic user message. With this change, we inform the user about the possibility of this being
caused due to the newly created groups not yet being visible to GCP IAM, and request them to try again after some time.

### Fixed deep links into partner area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Deep linking into a specific admin area page (e.g. by bookmarking the pgae) did not work if you haven't been logged in to
meshPanel before accessing the link. This has been fixed now.

### Throttling parallel collection of metering data
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The high number of integrated meshPlatform instances in certain meshStack installations resulted in many
metering data collections being run in parallel. This caused a high load on the database, which sometimes had an impact on the
meshStack performance. The meshPanel performance was also degraded in such cases. With this release, we have introduced
a throttling mechanism to ensure that only a limited number of parallel collections can run per platform type. With
this we will control the load on the database and ensure that the performance of meshStack does not degrade due to the
integration of a higher number of meshPlatform instances.

### Tenant ID for AKS Tenants is now shown
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the Tenants overview in the Admin area the Tenant Id was missing for AKS based Tenants.

### Tenant control plane integration
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the tenant control plane with all related child screens. Platform Access related screens like CLI Access,
Service Users and other platform-specific screens are available in the "Platform Access" tab of the tenant control plane.
Usage Reports are located in a separate "Finanicals" tab of the tenant control plane. The header of the tenant control
plane contains all relevant information of the tenant like its platform tenant id or the assigned landing zone.

### Project access control in project control plane
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the project access control page into the redesigned project page. The project access control is no longer available within the manage project area. Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### Template engine for replicator configuration
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
A powerful template engine allows simpler and more unified string replacements for the replicator
configuration strings. A unified set of placeholders can now be used in an easier templating format
to configure certain string patterns, like Azure Subscription names.
For more information please check the public documentation: http://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.replication-configuration.html#string-templating.

### Increased supported length for service description field
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There are three description fields that can be specified in the Open Service Broker service catalog.
They are service description, service plan description and service plan cost description. Previously, meshStack
supported a length of 256 characters for the service description and service plan description and a length of 5000
characters for the service plan cost description. This caused errors when parsing the service catalog if the description
was longer than what was supported. This has been changed to support 65,000 characters for all three description fields.
While we have made this change to ensure that the catalog is always up-to-date on meshStack, we recommend you to limit
the information that you put in the description so that it is easy to read and quickly understand the content.

### Badge also shows project bindings that expire soon
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
With the new look and feel of the customer control plane we introduced a badge showing the number of expired project access roles.
This number now also includes the number of project bindings that are expiring soon.
This should help you become aware of any project role bindings that will expire in the next seven days.

### Better mention customer name restrictions
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The name of a meshCustomer can be any length and contain any characters.
This information was not mentioned anywhere in meshStack.
To resolve this, it is now explicitly mentioned in the API docs & in the customer creation wizard.

### AKS multi role assignment
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A bug in the role assignment prevented the proper assigning of RoleBindings in the AKS cluster
if more than one meshRole was assigned to the same ClusterRole via the Landing Zone.

### Manage payment methods in project control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to manage your active & substitute payment method in the new project control plane that was recently introduced.
Keep in mind that more functionality will be moved to the new project control plane in future releases.

### Fix payment methods redirect in project creation flow
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
In the project creation flow there are two redirects to the list of payment methods.
These redirects were pointing to a non-existing URL. This is now fixed and the redirect brings
you to the correct page in the meshPanel.

### Fixes legacy Azure Subscription duplications
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes a regression that was introduced with v7.92.0 and broke the fallback mechanism to
protect against multiple Subscription creations during an error condition. Only the legacy Azure
Subscription creation was affected.
Note: The last release fixed the initial cause of Azure communication error during the Subscription
creation step leading to an error condition.

### Manage project tags in project control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to manage your project tags in the new project control plane that was recently introduced.
Keep in mind that more functionality will be moved to the new project control plane in future releases.

### Redesigned tenant overview in project control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The tenant overview in the project control plane got a slight redesign.
The overview is now more compact and shows additional information such as
the platform tenant identifier.

### Improved handling of new meshPlatform Quota Definitions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, if you added a new Quota Definition to a meshPlatform, it would show up with a default
value of zero in the corresponding meshLandingZones, but the quota was not applied to the tenants. With this release, we have
made some changes to make it clearer to you whether the quotas have been set or not. Now, if you add a new
quota definition to a meshPlatform and view a corresponding meshLandingZone in the meshPanel, you will clearly see that the
default value for the newly added quota definition is empty and that you have to add a default value there. When you
set this value on the meshLandingZone, all tenants with that meshLandingZone assigned will get assigned this quota
during the next replication of the tenant.
Additionally, if a tenant or a tenant quota request doesn't have a value set for a newly added quota definition,
an empty field will be shown in the panel, instead of a zero.

### Improve navigation error message
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If you encounter a navigation error in meshPanel, you only saw [object: Object] as an error message before. A new readable error message has been introduced for this.

### Access unassigned projects in 'Overview'-Tab
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
As a Customer Admin, you can now access the project access control plane of all projects via a click on the name in the project's overview. This also includes projects you're not assigned to.

### Correct date labels for key performance indicators
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Fixes a bug where the first data point in key performance indicator charts was labelled incorrectly with the wrong date.

### Improves access information for AKS
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Now the panel shows the proper login procedure for an AKS based Kubernetes platform.

### Fix OpenStack CloudResource Terminated Status
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
In rare cases, OpenStack CloudResources for Nova Servers have not been set correctly to the Terminated status.
This has been fixed now and already existing Cloud Resources with this issue are also fixed by this release.

### Landing Zone fee based on meshLandingZone identifier
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack already had the capability to charge a fee on the meshTenant based on the meshLandingZone that was assigned.
This fee was based on the name of the meshLandingZone, which caused the fee to not be applied when the name changed.
With this release, we add the capability to base the Landing Zone Fee on the recently introduced meshLandingZone
identifier which cannot be changed after the meshLandingZone is created. This means that any changes to meshLandingZone
will not affect the Landing Zone fee.

### Fix user invitation link in 'Manage Project'
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When trying to invite someone in the Project access control screen, you would end up on a 'not found' page. This issue is now fixed and you are redirected to the right page in the customer control plane.

### Prevent duplicate Azure Subscription creation via legacy API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This fixes a communication error happening with the legacy Azure Subscription creation API,
that could lead to a double Subscription creation in rare cases.

### Fixes form validation for Landing Zones
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Fixes the form validation and improves Save button behavior when editing a 
Landing Zone and setting up platform role mappings.

### Remove Groups menu item for non-Partner Admins
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The 'Groups' menu item in the Administration area was visible for all partner users even though this screen
only shows information for Partner Admins. To fix the issue, we now hide the menu item
if the user is not logged in as a Partner Admin.

### Fix redirect from 'Manage' button in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The 'Manage' button for managing your meshCustomer was broken and redirected to a non-existing page.
This has been fixed and the 'Manage' button will now redirect to the list of projects in the Account area instead.

### Introduced an identifier for meshLandingZone
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this release, we have introduced an identifier that should be specified when creating a meshLandingZone.
This identifier cannot be modified after creation and will uniquely identify a meshLandingZone. This field will be
auto generated for existing meshLandingZones.
This was introduced to ensure consistency with other concepts such as meshProjects and meshCustomers which already have an identifier property.

### Tenant Overview display bug
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes a partially failed migration that could lead to the Tenant overview not getting displayed in 
certain environments.

### Fixes AKS usage with multiple groups
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes the bug that multiple configured AKS role mappings prevented users from accessing the
AKS namespace.
Also lifts the requirement to setup the Azure UPN as meshUser EUID.

### Project overview contains all projects for Customer Admins
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
As a Customer Admin, you can now see all projects of your customer in the new customer control plane. If you are not assigned to the project you will see an info message and the row will be greyed out.

### Improves messages for tenant seq. number errors
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Error message now indicates the actual source of the problem instead of being generic.

### Customer deletion in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
As a Customer Owner, you can now delete your meshCustomer in the 'Danger Zone'. To delete the Customer, you have to navigate to Settings in the customer control plane and access the tab 'Danger Zone'. With this change, the whole 'General' section has moved to the new control plane. Navigating to Account by clicking on the cogwheel will lead you to the Projects page.

### Make all tenants available for private marketplaces
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When developing new service brokers you can use your private marketplace for development. Only your meshCustomer
has access to it. You can now select all meshTenants of the project for a tenant service in such a
private marketplace. Before the change you were only able to select tenants from the same location the marketplace
belongs to.

### Expired Project Access in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We have integrated the Expired Project Access page into the redesigned customer entry page.
Managing your Expired Project Access is no longer possible in the Account area. If you press the 'Expired Access' sidebar entry,
you will be automatically redirected to the new view.
Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### See number of pending access requests in tab view
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We have made it easier for Customer Admins to the see the number of pending access requests.
If you are in the customer control plane, the number badge of the 'Access Control' tab will now show
the number of pending access requests in blue (if you have any pending access requests). Customer Admins
can now quickly see if they are required to approve or decline any pending access requests.

### Project control plane integration
**Audience:** Customer, User<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the project control plane with all related child screens. The project dashboard is no longer available. The tenants and financials screens are integrated into the project control plane. Be aware that we'll incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### Fixes Tenants "last replication" sometimes not updating
**Audience:** Partner<br>

failed replication run.
This sometimes happened if a replication failed early in the replication process.

### Enables full ASK support
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Enables the replication support for Azure Kubernetes.
Adds the Kubernetes Landing Zone to setup role bindings and
quota management.

### Ensure only one active tenant quota request
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
In rare cases, multiple active tenant quota requests could be created for a single tenant. In those cases partners had not been able to edit quotas for that tenant. We now disable 'Create Quota Request' during the creation of tenant quota requests to ensure those cases do not happen.

### Change customer's tags in new control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
You can now change your Customer Tags under Settings in the new customer control plane.

### Fix long EGIDs overflowing user groups table
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We fixed the visual issue where a very long EGID for meshCustomerUserGroups could result in the 'User Groups' table overflowing and placing
other content outside of the container. This issue is now fixed and any long EGIDs are placed on new lines to prevent the table from overflowing.

### Removed Invite Link from Administration Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the customer list in the administration area there was a button for creating an invite link to your meshstack.
This invite link had no benefits as opposed to the regular registration URL. This is why the button has been removed.
In case you want to send others a link where they can register their meshCustomer, send them to https://<your-meshstack>/#/register.

### Create GCP Projects directly under the organization
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, meshStack did not support creating a GCP project directly under the organization. For example, if you
created a meshLandingZone with "Resource Manager Folder Id" set to the organization id, the replication of a GCP project
with that meshLandingZone assigned will fail.
With this release we have added this capability to meshStack, so that you can create GCP projects directly under
the organization level without nesting them inside folders.

### Cloud Foundry Domain Management in Customer Control Plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We have integrated the Cloud Foundry Domain management page into the redesigned customer entry page.
Managing your Cloud Foundry Domains is no longer possible in the Account area. If you press the 'Domains' sidebar entry,
you will be automatically redirected to the new view.
Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### Fix Cloud Foundry Domains not being created
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When trying to create a new Cloud Foundry domain, the panel would not save the result after confirming the creation.
This is now fixed and it is possible again to create new Cloud Foundry domains.

### AWS Reserved Instance metering related fix
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There was an issue which caused the AWS Reserved Instance metering to fail on the first day of the month.
This issue has been fixed with this release.

### Fix user identifier for SCIM API
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
There was an issue regarding a possibly missing id field in the SCIM API UserResource that has now been resolved.
Furthermore we improved the mechanism to match SCIM UserResources with existing users in meshStack to prevent
duplication of users.

### Unified AWS metering source
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this release, we have removed Cost & Usage Report based AWS metering from the product and have fully switched to
the more robust AWS Cost Explorer based metering. Cost explorer based metering results in lesser metering data collection and
generates usage reports that can be directly compared with the data shown in the Cost Explorer in the AWS Console.

### Fix declarative deletion of Customer Owner bindings
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
When using the declarative meshObject API by providing a meshObjectCollection during import,
it was not possible to remove a meshCustomerUserBinding of a Customer Owner via the API. This has been fixed.

### Replaced US date format with German date format
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description

Be aware that we'll incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### Service Brokers in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the service brokers page with all sub pages into the redesigned customer entry page. The service brokers are no longer available within the account area. If you press the service brokers sidebar entry then you'll be automatically redirected to the new view. Be aware that we'll incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### Change customer's name in new control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
You can now change your customer's name in the new customer control plane.

### Global user groups
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
We introduce user groups that are available on all meshCustomers, called global groups.
Those groups can be assigned to meshCustomers and meshProjects the same way as meshCustomer-bound meshCustomerUserGroups.
Global groups and their members cannot be created and maintained manually or via an API but can only be imported
via SCIM provisioning from an external system, such as an AAD.

### New ability to provide feedback
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
To allow you and your users to provide feedback more easily to the team at meshcloud, we deprecated the old feedback form
at the top of the meshPanel in favor of our new online platform at https://meshcloud.canny.io/ where anyone can publicly share feature requests, and more.
Make sure to have a look at what others have already submitted and feel free to upvote any ideas that you feel passionate about.
You can also open the feedback board via the thumbs up button at the top-right in the meshPanel.

**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The restructuring of the replication status document will allow easier functionality enhancement in the future.

### Disable Project Creation for Partner
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The project creation functionality for Partners is something we never recommended. With this release it is not possible anymore to create projects as a Partner.
The revision includes several changes in the partners view, the 'Account Area' and items related to partner's own project management has been removed from the screen. The former 'Groups'-Section in the 'Account'-Area has been moved to the Administration Area under 'Partner'.
Additionally, projects are no longer assignable to Partners via the API. If you do want to create projects & tenants as a cloud foundation team, we recommend creating a new meshCustomer for this.

### Customer User Groups moves to new control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The 'Groups' in the 'Account'-Area can now be found in the new customer control plane under the 'Access Control'-tab.

### Partner User Groups moves to Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

We've integrated the customer payment methods page into the redesigned customer entry page. The customer payment methods are no longer available within the account area. If you press the payment methods sidebar entry then you'll be automatically redirected to the new view. Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### Authentication exceptions don't spam logs anymore
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Long stacktraces from authentication exceptions inside the application won't spam
the logs anymore. They can be re-enabled by setting the log-level to debug.

### Chargeback statements in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the chargeback statements page into the redesigned customer entry page. The chargeback statements are no longer available within the account area.

#### Description
The 'Deletion Queue' can be found in the new Dashboard under the 'Projects'-tab.

### Fixes issue with AWS RI & SP metering
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
An issue in the AWS Reserved Instances and Savings Plans metering caused the processing of the collected items
to fail in rare situations which caused the tenant usage reports to be incomplete. This issue has been fixed
with this release.

### Declarative deletion for customer and project bindings
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this release we have implemented declarative deletion for the meshObject types meshCustomerUserBinding,
meshCustomerGroupBinding, meshProjectUserBinding and meshProjectGroupBinding.
Imagine you imported customer bindings and project bindings via the meshObject API and provided
a meshObjectCollection with that import. When you now execute a subsequent import of the same meshObjectCollection,
and some of those bindings are no longer provided in this import, these missing
bindings will be removed from meshStack. Please refer to the meshObject Import API
<a href="https://docs.meshcloud.io/api/">documentation</a> for more details about declarative deletion.

### Azure metering skips unsupported subscriptions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Azure documentation specifies
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data#supported-microsoft-azure-offers"> Offer Types</a>
which do not support Azure Cost Management. Calling the Azure Cost Management API on such subscriptions results in an error.
Because of this, we now filter out subscriptions which do not support the Azure Cost Management API.

### Improved UX of AWS SSO integration
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
UX of managing role mappings in AWS Landing Zones has been improved by providing clearer information and restrictions
of input fields. Additionally messages of replication errors have been improved, if creation of a group in AWS SSO failed.

### Customer access control in customer dashboard
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We've integrated the customer access control page into the redesigned customer entry page. The customer access control is no longer available within the account area. If you press the access control sidebar entry then you'll be automatically redirected to the new view. Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### Detailed user information
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
There is a new screen that shows detailed information for a selected user, for example, the e-mail, the last login date
and all the meshCustomers the user is assigned to. The screen can be reached by clicking on the name of a user within the
user list in the administration area.

### Logs failed replications due to seq. number
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
If a replication fails early due to a mismatch in the replication sequence number
this information is now properly propagated to the meshPanel for faster troubleshooting.

### Fix Access Denied error when importing meshServiceInstances
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When importing meshServiceInstances, an inconsistent authentication session was generated, which resulted in an access denied error if the JSESSIONID that was returned in the first response is used for the next call. This is now solved.

### AWS Control Tower integration improvement
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We improved the replication of meshTenants with configured AWS Control Tower enrollment.
This solves a potential issue that AWS accounts would not be found during the enrollment process.

### Added manage button again
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We've removed the manage button from the customer dashboard. This caused confusion and so we've added the button back.

### Disable Customer Owner required in Customer Access Control
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We will still enforce to have Customer Owners assigned during the creation of a meshCustomer in the meshPanel. In some cases it is necessary to manage access control within the account area without at least one Customer Owner assignment. We will temporarily disable the enforcement of the Customer Owner after the creation of a meshCustomer which will only have effect on exiting meshCustomers with no Customer Owner. We will get back to you with more information how we handle this in the future and make it work for you.

### Projects overview redesign
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
This is the first step to integrate our new UI design. We have designed the initial projects view to support a cleaner and lightweight UI/UX. In the future, we will integrate all other customer-related functionalities step by step into a single spot to make it more user-friendly. Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in this new view in the coming weeks.

### Fix "no user and group found" in Project Access Control
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
You can now search users and groups in the Project Access Control Section again. Due to a bug, groups and also users who are members of groups could not be found.

### Fix duplicate users in user lookup due to attribute order
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The Identity Lookup, when configured, will look up users from two sources: the meshStack database and the configured
enterprise user directory. If the two sources find a user with the same username or email, that user will be considered
the same user. This comparison gave priority to the email if it was available and this resulted in some users being
listed twice if the user had different emails assigned in the two sources. Now both username and email are given equal
priority and if either the username or the email matches, the two found users will be considered to be the same user.
This fixes the issue of duplicate users showing up in the identity lookup.

### Fixes losing GCP project association during creation
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes a rare condition of the replicator losing track of a created GCP project. 
This could only happen if the replication process was interrupted for a longer period of time during GCP project creation.

### Project CSV export contains deleted tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes an issue that prevented already deleted tenants to be included in the CSV export of meshCustomer projects.
This behavior is now consistent again with the earlier export functionality.

### Fix Customer export with empty groups
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the meshCustomer export in the admin area from working if a meshCustomer
with an empty user group existed.

### Multiline meshLandingZone description
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating or editing a meshLandingZone, you can now specify a multiline description. This description will be shown
in a multiline format when a user assigns a meshLandingZone to a tenant. This allows you to better communicate
landing zone related information to the users of meshStack.

### Improved customer access control
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
The customer access control was improved regarding the look and the interaction. Less steps are required to manage the assignments. Therefore, it's no longer necessary to press the save button after a customer role was changed.

### Dedicated access control in administration area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Partner admins now have the ability to control their access in the administration area. This makes it faster to manage access control in the partner account, as opposed to navigating to the 'Account' area. In a future release, we will remove the account area from the administration area.

### Fixed filter when listing meshUsers in API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We've fixed a filtering issue for the meshUsers List endpoint where some users would not show up.
The endpoint now considers both meshUsers that are assigned directly to a meshProject and meshUsers that are
assigned via a meshCustomerUserGroup to a meshProject when filtering meshUsers by their meshProject.

### Fix duplicate users in user lookup due to case-sensitivity
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The Identity Lookup, when configured, will look up users from two sources: the meshStack database and the configured
enterprise user directory. If the two sources find a user with the same username or email, that user will be considered
the same user. This comparison of username and email used to be case-sensitive. We have changed that to be case-insensitive
because meshStack treats usernames and emails in a case-insensitive manner. This fixes the issue of duplicate users showing up in the identity lookup.

### Fixes issue in metrics based metering counters
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There was an issue in metrics based metering counters which caused certain counts at the end of the month or start of
the month to be charged to the wrong month. This issue has been fixed and the counts will be charged to the correct
month from now on.

### Marketplace identifier on Service Broker Development page
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the Service Broker Development page in the Account area of your meshCustomer, you can now see the marketplace
identifier alongside the marketplace name of the meshMarketplace to which a service broker has been published.
This helps to identify the marketplace identifier more easily for importing meshServiceInstances via the meshObject Import API.

### Fixed filter when listing meshUsers in API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We've fixed a filtering issue for the meshUsers List endpoint.
The endpoint now considers both, meshUsers that are assigned directly to a meshCustomer and meshUsers that are
assigned via a meshCustomerUserGroup to a meshCustomer, when filtering meshUsers by their meshCustomer.

### Drag and drop tags to change the order
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Tags can now be drag and dropped to change the order of meshTags in the Tag Editor. This order is applied to all
places where tags are shown, such as displaying tags of meshObjects and the tag overview in the Tag Editor.

### Refine meshTenant quota request count
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshPanel dashboard shows a count of pending tenant quota requests that must be handled by platform operators.
This count has been refined so that pending requests on already deleted meshTenants will not be counted in. In
addition to that, the respective link will now directly navigate to the meshTenant overview screen with a preselection
applied, so that only meshTenants with pending quota requests are listed.

### Fix AWS Console Access via meshPanel with SSO
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We cleared out a bug that prevented users to access their AWS accounts via the meshPanel,
although the replication was successful and access was possible in general. This happened
only in case AWS SSO was configured for the respective accounts.

### Possibility to set meshUser email from AAD attribute
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to set the email of a user looked up via AAD to a different attribute rather than the standard email attribute.
This is useful if you want the users in meshStack to not use their primary email but some secondary email. This feature
should only be used in very specific situations. There is already a feature in place which allows you to set the username
of a user with an AAD attribute. These two features cannot be used together.

### Fix broken checkbox
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
On the screen for creating or editing new Landing Zones the checkbox within the AWS Landing Zone properties
for account enrollment to AWS Control Tower was always disabled. This has now been changed that it is only
disabled in edit mode, but can be checked for the creation of a new AWS Landing Zone.

### Fixed filter when listing meshUsers in API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We've fixed a filtering issue for the meshUsers List endpoint. It could happen that users with the wrong role were returned. This is now fixed and every filter option will be correctly applied.

### Fixes issue in AWS access role auto downgrade
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If the "account access role" which meshStack assumes to perform tasks in the newly provisioned account had a path prefix,
the auto downgrade of the role would fail with an error that says the role name is invalid. This issue has been fixed and the
access role auto downgrade is now successfully executed even when there is a path prefix for the role.

### Fixed Admin Area button not working for some users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously the admin area button worked only if the partner was assigned to another customer. Now it's possible to use the admin area button independent of the customer assignment.

### Better distinction between fieldsets for service parameters
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To make multiple fieldsets better distinguisable, we added a bold font for
the title of the fieldset, and a small indentation for each fieldset.
This will make long service parameter forms more user friendly.

### Fixes Monitor deployment
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Removes docker_prune ansible module from deployment since it is not supported by all meshStacks.

### AWS Account Enrollment per LZ
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, account enrollment for AWS accounts to AWS Control Tower could be enabled on a platform level only.
With this change it is now possible to set a flag per Landing Zone to decide whether created AWS accounts of this
Landing Zone will be enrolled in AWS Control Tower or not. This allows platform operators to configure different behavior around account enrollment for a single platform.

### Prevent creation of tenants without a landing zone
**Audience:** Customer, Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
For platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP and OpenShift a landing zone is mandatory for a successful replication.
Tenants for these platforms can no longer be created if no landing zone is available. An according
info message is shown to the user in meshPanel.

### Fix replicated platform tags not showing for partners
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The replicated platform tags have not been shown to partners in the tenant detail screen.
This issue has been fixed now and the platform tags are shown correctly.

### Improve Kubernetes/OpenShift metering robustness
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Improved robustness for collecting cpu usage across different Kubernetes versions.

### Scheduled tasks related improvements
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There was an issue in the scheduled task execution which in rare cases blocked certain scheduled tasks like polling service instance
status. This issue has been fixed with this release.

### Fix UI issue when deleting service instances
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When deleting a service instance from a synchronous service broker, it was still shown in the UI after deletion.
Only a refresh showed that the instance has actually been removed. This is fixed now and the service instance
is removed from the list after deleting it.

### Strict identifier validation
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
meshStack now applies a more strict validation of identifiers (meshProject, meshCustomer, service broker). Identifiers
must not contain leading, trailing or consecutive dashes. This will be validated from now on when creating new
meshProjects, meshCustomers or service brokers. Existing ones are not affected by this change. This limitation is being
applied as some platforms require these strict rules, e.g. AWS has this rule in place for AWS account aliases.

### Fix issue in meshObject Import API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
An issue with the lookup and filtering of meshPaymentMethods was identified and removed that could lead to
errors when importing new or existing meshProjects without a specified meshPaymentMethod via the meshObject
Import API.

### Fix username when user looked up from AAD
**Audience:** Operator, Customer<br>

#### Description
When adding a user that was looked up in Azure Active Directory to a meshCustomer, the username has been set to the UPN from Azure recently.
This resulted in some strange looking usernames that included #EXT#. We now set the email address as a default for these users. Already 
affected usernames have been updated automatically to the email address.

### Flexible AWS metering data collection schedule
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
AWS metering data collection schedule can now be configured on an hourly or daily basis. For example, every eight hours,
every twelve hours, every day, or every two days. This feature was introduced because we plan to fully switch to the
AWS Cost Explorer for AWS metering. By configuring a less frequent schedule, you have the possibility to reduce the
costs incurred when calling the API.

### Apply hyphen sanitization for AWS Account Alias
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
AWS account aliases are restricted regarding usage of hyphens. An alias must not start or end with a hyphen.
Additionally it must not contain consecutive hyphens. This sanitization is now applied by meshStack's replicator
before setting an account alias.

### Add PersistentVolumeClaims to OpenShift/Kubernetes metering
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
PersistentVolumeClaims in OpenShift and Kubernetes can now be collected and charged by meshMetering.
A price can be defined per capacity of the PersistentVolumeClaim. Different prices can be defined 
according to the storage class being used and the status of the volume claim.

### Provide OpenShift/Kubernetes localIds in meshObject API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
OpenShift and Kubernetes tenants did not provide a localId via the meshObject API. These localIds
are provided correctly now.

### Auto-Approval of quota requests up to defined threshold
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to define an auto-approval threshold per Platform Quota Definition. If a quota request is created where all
quotas are below the according defined threshold, the request will be auto-approved. This will reduce the load of platform operators
regarding approval of quota requests. It will also reduce the time for customers to wait for an approval to zero as long as their request
is below the defined threshold. The auto-approval will also be applied when only reducing quotas.

### Fix OpenShift platform type in meshMetering
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
OpenShift metering data was assigned to platform type Kubernetes. This didn't actually break anything,
but it e.g. showed the Kubernetes logo instead of the OpenShift logo in Usage Reports and Chargeback Statements.
Additionally type Kubernetes had to be defined for OpenShift platforms in the Price Catalog. This has been fixed
now and OpenShift is handled in meshMetering with the correct platform type now.

### Temporary removal of Platform Access chart on landing page
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** monitoring


#### Description
meshStack displays a Platform Access chart in the bottom of the meshcloud landing page. We have identified an issue in a third party
solution which is being used to generate this chart (for details see https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer/issues/269).
This issue has the possibility to harm other monitoring components in a meshstack. As a result, we are temporarily removing the component
to protect the remaining monitoring components. We are actively looking both with the authors of the third-party component as well as internally
for a solution.

### Flexible OpenShift Pod CPU product catalog units
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Operators can now configure product catalog entries for OpenShift Pod CPU usage
with prefixed units. Previously products could only be specified on "milli CPU" in the
units of mCPU. Operators can now define prices with any SI-prefix, e.g. "mCPU", "CPU" or "kCPU".
This allows presenting OpenShift pod consumption in human-readable and intuitive units.

### Replicator downgrades its own AWS permissions
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
After the replicator provisions a new AWS account, it initially has administrator access in this new account.
Previously, some of you would have implemented your own mechanism via CloudFormation or Lambda to downgrade this role
to have the minimum required access.
From this release onwards, the replicator is capable of downgrading its own permissions.
If you already have custom  mechanisms to downgrade this role, please remove those mechanisms before
deploying this release.

### Import of user groups without members
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Customer user group having no members can now be successfully imported via the identity connector.

### Improved Error Message during meshProject Import
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API now returns a meaningful error message when importing a meshProject fails due to a meshCustomer
quota violation. This situation can occur when the meshCustomer has too many projects and exceeds the
meshProject limit quota.

### Templates now supported with OpenShift 4
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
OpenShift Templates defined in a Landing Zone are now also correctly applied to OpenShift 4 clusters.
With OpenShift 4 an API endpoint meshStack used to apply templates has been removed. meshStack now uses
the template.openshift.io v1 API. This change is backward compatible for OpenShift 3.

### Get your meshUsers via the API
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Retrieve all meshUsers via the API and filter them by their meshCustomer, their meshProject and their roles via the corresponding role name. You can find the role names in the regarding Access Control Section in the panel. You can also filter them by the platform they have access to. To do so, you need to provide the corresponding identifier of the platform which can be found under "Platform Identifier" on the meshPlatforms page.

### Platform integration via config
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With this change meshStack is able to load platform configuration at startup time. Potentially existing
locations and platforms will be checked against the specified configuration and modified accordingly.
New locations and platforms will be created, if applicable. Also unwanted locations and platforms
will be deleted. This will simplify and speed up future platform integrations. Currently marketplace
platforms cannot yet be configured this way.

### Improved error handling of failed AWS SSO account assignment
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
If an account assignment via AWS SSO failed, it could happen that the failure was not visible
in the replication result. This has been fixed now and an according detailed message is available
in the replication result so operators know how to resolve the underlying issue.

### Fix policy violation message showing empty values
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
It could happen that a policy violation message would mention that a tag value was set to "(none)", even though there is an actual tag value set. This is now fixed and the policy violations message will show the accurate tag values.

### Improved awareness of failing service broker metrics calls
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
meshcloud will be actively informed about problems occurring for a longer time when calling
service broker metric endpoints. That way issues can be handled in time before chargeback
statements are generated. This will prevent potentially missing some service broker metrics
in the chargeback statements. We will reach out to the cloud foundation team when this situation occurs.

### Made it more clear that project identifiers are immutable
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the project creation wizard, the description has been changed to make it more clear that a project identifier
is immutable and that it cannot be changed after creating the project. This should make more users aware that changing
a project identifier is not possible.

### Replication settings for tags have immediate effect
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Changing the replication settings on a tag in the administration area has immediate effect.
From that point on the next replication will add or remove the tag on the tenant in the cloud platforms.

### Altered description around behavior of quotas set to zero
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The description of quota behavior around zeros has been updated to reflect the accurate behavior of OpenShift.
Previously, the quota management user interface mentioned that a quota value of zero means the resource can be used unlimited.
This turned out to be not true for OpenShift and the description has been changed to reflect this behavior and make it more
clear to platform operators and end-users.
For the future, consult the platform documentation for the behavior of quota values as meshstack transfers these values 1-to-1.

### Flexible scopes for discounts
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack already had the ability to create discount line items in the tenant usage report. The discount could be
applied to all line items belonging to a specific seller.
With this release, we have improved this ability and extended the discount scope to support matching products and
usage types. Furthermore, we have added the ability to configure a regular expression for all three parameters(seller, product, usage type)
instead of an exact match, which makes the discounting feature even more flexible.

### AWS Reserved Instance & Savings Plan upfront fee line items
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In a previous release, we added the functionality in meshStack to add a discount line item
matching the amortized cost of the upfront fee of any AWS Reserved Instance or Savings Plan that was purchased
by a specific meshCustomer.
With this release, we have added the functionality to also show the initial upfront fee for the Savings Plan or the
Reserved Instance in the tenant usage report. This fee will show up in the month the Savings Plan or the Reserved
Instance starts.

### Missing user and system remarks during Tenant replication
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes rare cases in which user and system remarks of Replication Steps were not properly saved, and thus missing e.g. in the
meshTenant overview, after a failed replication.

### Maintenance screen for Platform Quota Definitions
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
A UI to manage quota definitions of each platform has been added.
Quotas can be added, edited or deleted.

### Improves Azure Subscription error handling
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Improves handling of Azure errors during Subscription creation.

### More resilient handling of unavailable meshStack components
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
In some cases a not available component (e.g. a database) had led to not being able to log in
to meshStack at all. This is now handled more tolerantly and meshStack only degrades certain functionality that
depends on the specific component.

### Add myself during customer creation
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It's now possible to add yourself to the access control list during the customer creation via a button. This simplifies the self assignment.

### Assign multiple users during customer registration
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The customer registration access control wizard now supports the assignment of multiple users with different roles. It's necessary that at least one customer owner is assigned to register a new customer successfully.

### Trims Service Instance status description
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
More than 1024 chars in the status descriptions of a Service Instance lead to failure in updating/saving this
instance.
To prevent errors this field is now trimmed down to this maximum length.

### Marketplace metering improvements
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This change includes a few improvements in the marketplace metering area.
In certain scenarios, a private service broker that was deleted and re-imported with the same identifier resulted
in the service instances being charged twice. To prevent this, we now do not allow the deletion, but only allow the
deactivation of a private service broker. After deactivation, you can re-import the service broker with a different
identifier.
If a private service broker with metrics was deleted, or if a metrics endpoint was removed from the service catalog
of an existing service broker, it blocked the marketplace tenant usage report finalization. This issue has also been
fixed.

### Link to AWS SSO Sign In
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The AWS Console screen in meshPanel now redirects to the AWS SSO Sign In page, if AWS SSO is configured for the meshPlatform.
If users are already logged in via their enterprise IdP, they can directly select the AWS Account they want to access via that AWS
SSO Sign In page.

### Cloud Resources are now sorted by creation date
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
When retrieving all cloud resources it was possible that some resources appeared
multiple times on different pages of the result list. This could happen if new resources
have been added while querying all pages. This has been fixed now by sorting the Cloud Resources
by their createdAt date.

### Additional metadata for tenant tagging
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to tag your platform tenants (e.g. Azure subscription or AWS account)
with the following additional metadata: Project Name, Customer Name, Payment Identifier,
Payment Name, Payment Expiration Date. It can be configured which of these parameters will 
actually be applied to your platform tenants.

### Fixes issue with assigning users to GCP projects
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes an issue with the user assignment to GCP projects. The issue occurred if the email of a user who is already
assigned to a GCP project was changed, and the old email was set as an alias. Before this fix, trying to assign such a user
resulted in a failed replication of the project. Now, replication finishes successfully with the correct users assigned.

### Improvements to GCP metering & billing
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, meshStack collected the GCP billing data available in Big Query as is, without performing any summarization.
This proved to be too much of a load to the meshStack and the database. Because of this, we now perform a daily aggregation
in Big Query, before we import the data into meshStack.
This change makes the GCP metering implementation more robust and able to handle higher amounts of usage data coming
from GCP.

### Fix redirect for partners creating customers
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
Partners will no longer be redirected to the external customer registration page if it was configured. They will be redirected to the customer registration in the panel instead.

### Fixes duplicate Azure Subscription groups
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
If meshstack replicated a tenant that had both a Azure marketplace as well as an Azure 
platform configured it could happen that duplicate user groups were created on a Subscription. 
The replication process will cleanup those duplicates now.

### Customer access control during registration
**Audience:** Customer, User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We've introduced the additional customer registration step to control the access of users. As of now, only the customer owner can be assigned. In a future update, it will also be possible to assign Customer Admins & Customer Employees.

### AWS Control Tower integration
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
AWS platforms can now be configured in a way that the associated AWS Accounts (meshTenants) will be
enrolled with an existing AWS Control Tower environment. With the enrollment approach, account creation
will still be meshStack's responsibility and not delegated to the Account Factory. Instead, Account Factory
will only be used to enroll the account to AWS Control Tower. To perform enrollment, meshStack needs the
management account id and the productId of the Account Factory Product in AWS Service Catalog.
Details can be found here:
https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.aws.landing-zones.html#aws-control-tower-integration

### Result code field for meshObject import API
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
There is a new field 'resultCode' that is included in the response of the meshObject import API
for each meshObject. The purpose of this field is to provide a defined code in addition to the
'status' and 'message' fields. Currently there are two defined result codes, CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND and
PROJECT_NOT_FOUND. They indicate failure whenever a specified meshCustomer or meshProject could not
be found during the import of another meshObject.

### AWS SSO Integration
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack now supports an integration with AWS SSO for AWS platforms. Previously you were only able to integrate
AWS by configuring the meshIdB as an IdP in AWS. The AWS SSO integration enables using your enterprise IdP for logging
in to AWS. AWS SSO is a rather new component in AWS and it simplifies the Identity federation. It also improves the login
experience to AWS for end users. meshStack will make sure that meshUsers who are assigned to a meshProject get access
to the according AWS account. This AWS SSO integration will be the new standard integration supported by meshStack.
The meshIdB integration will be deprecated.

### API support for meshTenant Quotas
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
The meshTenant GET API will now include information about quotas that are applied to the meshTenants
either directly or via the Landing Zone. It is now also possible to use the meshObject Import API to
directly specify quota settings on imported meshTenants. The imported quotas will override existing quotas
and missing quota keys will be filled with the Landing Zone defaults.

### Policy violation message shown when creating a customer
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Previously, when creating a customer and an error occurs because of a policy violation, the reason was not properly
shown. This is now fixed and properly formatted so the user can know the reason and do the necessary correction.

### meshObject APIs always have page parameters in 'self' link
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
When making use of page parameters (eg. page=2 and size=1) in the external API, these parameters might be  missing in the 'self' link
of returned response. This problem is solved now and the 'self' link will always contain the correct parameters.

### Fixes incorrect username being set during role assignment
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There was an issue which caused the wrong username to be set when a user is newly added to meshStack
via customer role assignment on the panel. This happened if Azure Active Directory was configured as an identity
source and the username was derived from an attribute that was coming from AAD. This issue has been fixed with this
release and the username is now set correctly on the user.

### Fixes issue when declining customer role request
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Customer role request removal failed for users with no other pending or assigned binding requests, if that user
had previously received a customer message. This issue has been fixed and customer role requests for such users
can be removed via the panel.

### Adding and changing tags are now always visible immediately
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** release-notes


#### Description
After you have added or modified a tag, you can now verify the changes instantly in the "Tags"-section of a meshObject. In some cases, a page refresh was required, which is now fixed. You can either create or edit a meshObject (e.g Project) and check the "Tags"-section of it to verify your changed tag(s).

### Fixes issue in meshCustomer deletion
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There was an issue in the meshCustomer deletion if the customer had a user assigned and the user was deleted
from the partner area at some point. This issue has been fixed and you can now delete such customers.

### Fixed some tags not being able to be mandatory
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It was not possible to set some older landing zone and payment method tags to "mandatory". This is now fixed.

### Single-select tag fields can be cleared
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Values in tag fields that have the type "Single-Select" can now be cleared out. This means users can set an empty value to the field. (This does not apply to mandatory tags)

### Landing Zone name in Tenant detail view
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Besides being able to see the landing zone name in the list of tenants, the detailed view of a single tenant
now also contains this piece of information.

### Customers are created only in a one way
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Customer creation in the administration area with dialog box is now changed to regular customer creation method.
Partners users are now able to edit restricted customer tags which are not possible for regular users.

### Support AAD alternate mail in user check
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
meshStack can be configured to deny adding users to meshCustomers, if they cannot be found by their email address
in the configured identity lookup source. This check supports verifying users by their alternate mail address
configured in AAD now.

### Resilient Azure replication when missing user
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Users who can't be successfully invited will no longer set the invitation step to "Pending". This resulted in all project users not being able to access the Azure subscription. All following operations will exclude the user(s) with a pending invitation. The tenant overview will contain a remark with which user(s) are missing from the replication so the issue with these user(s) can be resolved.

### AAD users can be looked up by alternate email
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When searching for a user to assign him/her to a customer and Azure Active Directory (AAD) is used for that lookup,
meshStack now also searches on the alternate email address for that user. In some cases only an alternate email
address and no primary email address is set in AAD. This can now be handled by meshStack.

### Improved replicator error message
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** replicator


#### Description
In case the platform configuration for the replication is missing or misconfigured,
an error message is shown in the pre-replication phase. The wording of this message has been
improved so it can be understood better.

### Added landing zone column to tenant view
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The name of the landing zone for tenants that support landing zones is now visible in the 
tenant view and can be filtered upon.
The "tenant status" header has been changed to "replication" and the status text has been shortened
by removing "replication" from the text.

### New Offline and Unknown statuses for OpenStack VMs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
In the resources section in the panel admin area, we have now introduced a new 'Offline' status.
If the VM status reported by OpenStack is in one of PAUSED, SHELVED, SHELVED_OFFLOADED, SHUTOFF, SOFT_DELETED or SUSPENDED
we consider that VM to be in status 'Offline'.
We have also introduced an 'Unknown' status, which will cover any status reported by OpenStack, which are unknown to the
meshStack.
These two new statuses will also be available in the getExternalCloudResources endpoint of the meshMetering API.

### Policy violations are visible during project tags edit
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
After you're done editing tags of your customer's project and clicked on the "Save"-button, violated policies are now displayed in the error message.
The improvement of this message supports you to understand why you could not save the desired tags configuration.

### Simplified project deletion for operators
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is no longer needed to input the project identifier when confirming the deletion of a project as an operator.
The reason field when confirming the deletion of a project has also been replaced with an optional comment.

### Fix creation of new meshTags in Tag Catalog
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
With v7.73.0 an issue was introduced when creating a new meshTag in the meshPanel. After creation of a new meshTag,
the creation and edit screens of the given meshObject did not allow editing tags anymore. This has been fixed now.

### Clean up of deleted tenants
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There were references to deleted tenants in the database which lead to them being charged tenants fees and
landing zone fees. These references have now been removed.

### Resource optimization for data processing
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
There were some billing and metering related database operations which caused high memory consumption on the
database. We have made some improvements to prevent this from happening.

### Filters applied via URL fixed
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It is possible to share URL links of panel components with others in the organizations. The problem of filters in URL
not applying for Payment table and Policy violation table is now solved. This makes working together a little easier.

### AWS Cost Explorer for metering and billing
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
meshStack can now be configured to use the AWS Cost Explorer for collecting metering and billing data instead of using
AWS Cost & Usage Reports. This change will reduce the load on meshStack and we plan to deprecate and later fully
remove the use of AWS Cost & Usage Reports.
With this feature, we also support fair chargeback for AWS Reserved Instances and AWS Savings Plans which were purchased
by specific meshCustomers. The amortized cost of the upfront fee for the reserved instance or savings plan will be shown as
a discount line item in the usage report, because the meshCustomer has already made this payment.

### Payment Methods in Project Lists
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
The project lists in the partner and customer area now show the active payment method for each project.

### Fixes broken replication for re-added Tenant
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
If a meshTenant was deleted and later re-added for the same platform, a bug could prevent
the successful replication of a meshTenant in this platform instance.

### Prevent reuse of existing tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When importing a tenant with an explicit localId, the replication process could potentially
reuse existing cloud platform tenants which were already used by a previous meshProject.
This lead to the inability of the billing system to differentiate between cost items of
the two meshProjects and resulted in a duplicate billing taking place.
As reusing a tenant is not supported by meshstack, this change will prevent the replication
process to reuse an already used tenant. If this were ever to occur, the tenant overview in the
administration area will give a clear error message when this happens.
If this change is impacting your meshstack in any way, please get in touch with us.

### Improved tag value selection in meshObjects
**Audience:** Operator, User<br>

#### Description
We changed the behavior during the deprecation of a tag value. If you deprecate a tag value in the tag catalogue for any meshObject the tag value will no longer be available. This means new and existing meshObjects such as meshProjects, meshCustomer and meshLZ which weren't tagged with this value so far will not longer be able to use it in the future. For existing meshObjects that already use the value which is going to be deprecated, the selection will stay and the tag needs to be updated manually for each object. We will work on mechanisms to make users aware if they used deprecated tags so they can update them in time. This behavior will prevent premature policy violations caused by tag deprecation. 
selected then default value will be set if available.

### Azure Cloud Functions freely available in private cloud
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Azure Cloud Functions used in Landing Zones no longer need to be whitelisted when running in a private cloud environment without internet access.

### Resilient Service Broker handling in Metering
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Unavailable or broken metrics endpoints provided by service brokers no longer lead to all Marketplace
Usage Reports being delayed to the next Chargeback Statement.

#### How to use
Service Owners have to be aware, that if they don't provide metrics before the tenant usage reports are
finalized (which is usually four days after the end of the month),
this will result in those metrics not being fully considered in the Usage Reports and Chargeback Statements.

### Allow HTML in platform notifications
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to enter valid HTML into platform notification messages, which will be
rendered accordingly. This is useful for e.g. supplying direct links to an internal
wiki page for further explanation, or using custom styling. There is now also a
preview section so you can get an idea of how the notification is presented to end users.

### Tenant Detail View shows all assigned tags
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
The tags section of a Tenant now also provides the tags derived from the corresponding meshCustomer and meshPaymentMethod.

#### How to use
In the administration area, go to: Platforms > Tenant > View More > Tags

### Enable to reuse usernames
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
We make it possible for you to reuse the username. Therefore you can invite a user with a username which once belonged to a deleted user or reinvite him/her with the same username once he/she has been deleted.

### Fix mCUG not being assignable when identifier is duplicate
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We fixed a bug where a meshCustomerUserGroup (mCUG) of which its identifier existed more than once
in the system was not assignable to customer and project roles. When designing your organization in meshstack,
always keep in mind that the meshCustomerUserGroups are designed to be unique per meshCustomer,
and not on a global level.

### Rename Admin Area menu entries for Service Brokers
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
The menu entries for managing Service Brokers in the Admin Area sidebar have been renamed.
You can now find Service Brokers under Marketplace -> Service Brokers.

### No Tenant Fee for unmanaged Tenants
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack already had the ability to charge a tenant fee on a tenant. This change will ensure that the tenant fee
will not be charged on unmanaged tenants. In other words, the tenant fee will no longer show up in the Tenant
Usage Reports of unmanaged tenants. This change affects all three cloud platforms for which a tenant fee is supported,
namely, AWS, GCP and Azure.

### Pending replications shows blue info
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When accessing a platform and replication is still pending an info is shown. Previously pending replications were displayed as errors.

### Switch to latest Azure role assignment API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Certain built-in Azure roles were unable to get managed via the older API version. To support the latest
Azure roles, the API version was updated.

### Fix alias name issue with new Azure EA Subscription API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes an issue where illegal characters in the Subscription Alias name could lead to failure of 
creating new Subscriptions via the new Azure Enterprise Agreement API.

### Fixes issue in metrics based metering
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There was an issue in the metrics based marketplace metering area which caused the data collection to fail when a service
had multiple metrics resources with the same metric type. This has been fixed. Additionally, a change has been
made to make sure that we only start certain metering data collections from two months ago, which reduces the amount
of data that will be collected in the first collection run.

### Unmanaged Tenants no longer contain meshTenants
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Whenever platform tenants are collected (e.g. Azure subscriptions), the system now checks
if any of these were unmanaged tenants before but were converted into meshTenants in the meantime.
This issue could occur when using the meshObject Import API for importing
an unmanaged tenant into a meshProject. The list of unmanaged tenants
in the Admin area no longer contains these meshTenants.

### Complete audit trail for meshProject role changes
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There were some actions that were not present in the audit trail for meshProject role assignments and removal. These are now transparent and
the complete audit trail for meshProject role changes can be seen in the project history on a per user basis as well as per group basis.
Additionally, the role changes are sent to the users via email if emails are enabled.

### Improvement of payment method selection
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
We exclude expired payment methods during the selection of payment methods in the panel, so you won't select expired ones by mistake. 
Furthermore, we display the expiration date of the selected payment method during a project creation and make an approaching expiration date visible when editing a project.

### Payment method fields validation to accept meaningful info
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Validation of field of payment method (amount) is now available which restrict user to add
meaningless or random data.

### Assign platforms instead of locations to projects
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You are now able to select individual platforms for your project instead of assigning all platforms that belong
to a certain location to your project. This allows you to only add the platforms you want to use to your project
even if there are multiple platforms available in one location.
Also for already existing projects you will now see on all screens which platforms are assigned instead of locations.
This provides a better overview on which platforms are actually used within a project.

#### How to use
During project creation or when editing a project you will now be able to select platforms instead of locations for
your project. You will also be able to remove a single platform from your project, if you no longer need it. This is now
possible per platform, so you can keep one platform of a location on your project, but remove another one.

### Info message on tenant creation before creating project
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Added a small info message to the last step of the project creation wizard to make clear
to users that the replication of certain platform tenants might take a while.

### URL encodes non-ASCII header for Lambda calls
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Enables calling of Lambda functions for Azure and GCP (AWS was not affected) with non
ASCII parameters. These parameter are now URL encoded as described in RFC 2616.
It might be possible that on the receiving side, in the Lambda functions,
these parameters must be decoded before usage.

### Fixes duplicate replication remarks
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Fixes the duplicate inclusion of user and system remarks into a replication result. This happened only on rare occasions.

### Fix manual replication trigger and tenant quota mgtm
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With the latest release a bug was introduced that broke the manual trigger for the replication of tenants in the Admin Area.
It was also not possible to manage quotas for tenants in the Admin Area. This has been fixed now.

### Fixes error messages when accessing non-replicated project
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Improves the error messages when trying to access meshProjects that have not yet fully replicated
into the cloud tenant and thus can not be accessed.

### Improved Azure LZ Management Group description
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
To guarantee proper replication, you need to use the Management Group ID 
inside an Azure Landing Zone. This was clarified in the description.

### IdentityConnector adds warning for duplicate meshObjects
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Depending on the configuration or the data handled via the Identity Connector, it can happen that
meshObjects with identical identifiers are generated. This usually indicates a configuration problem 
but was easily missed. The added warnings and metrics make it easier for operators to spot such problems.

### No Policy violations for deleted meshProjects
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Policy Violations had also been created for deleted meshProjects. This has been fixed now, so no more policy violations are created for already deleted meshProjects.

### Fixed replication status not showing in project dashboard
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The replication status in the project dashboard was no longer working. This is now fixed and it is visible again
for all cloud platforms.

### Official JSON support for meshObject Import API
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
meshObject Import API supports data in the request body using the JSON format, as opposed to YML. Additionally, multiple meshObjects can be imported using a JSON array.
Single meshObjects are also accepted using a simple JSON object.

### Configurable HTTP timeout for IdentityConnector
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
To account for slow transfers and/or big meshObject YML files the HTTP request timeout
for the IdentityConnector is now configurable and set to 300s per default.

### Error reference IDs for panel error messages
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With this feature, we have introduced reference IDs to the errors that are shown in the panel. When you report
an issue to meshcloud, please mention this ID in the ticket, because it will help in investigating the issue.

### Simplified Local Id mappings of deleted projects
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the "Deleted Projects" section in the Admin area, deleted projects can be expanded to see the actual Ids of their tenants in the platform.
This has been a list of rather technical mapping codes in the past. This is now simplified by just showing the localId of the
tenant in the platform as well as the customer local id if used in the platform (e.g. grouping projects by customer via OpenStack domains).

### Improved Audit Trail for meshCustomerUserGroups
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** releasenotes


#### Description
We improved the auditing for changes within the member list of a meshCustomerUserGroups.
As a result audit events are now written on meshCustomer and meshProject level
in case any meshUser roles change due to (un-)assignment of meshUsers to
meshCustomerUserGroups.

### Improved OpenStack token handling
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
The OpenStack token handling in the UI has been improved. It now allows disabling certain screen for specific platforms that don't support these screens.

### Unique meshCustomer names
**Audience:** Partner, Customer, Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
meshCustomer names are now unique and validated when creating a new customer or updating an existing one. This also
affects the meshObjectImport. The creation of a meshCustomer with an already used meshCustomer name is not possible
anymore. Already existing meshCustomer names that are used more than once will not be removed.

### Duplicate user creation issue fixed
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If a user was invited via meshPanel, never logged in, and then was imported via API it resulted in a duplicated user.
This issue has now been fixed. From now on we will detect and match users that are created via different sources.

### Monitoring of replicator performance
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We now collect metrics around the replication process to detect errors early on.

### Improve clarity of Project Deletion Confirmation
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
We improved the textual explanation of the project deletion confirmation dialog by making it more explicit what happens exactly. After confirming the deletion of a meshProject which requires a manual deletion by an operator, the project is marked for deletion. From that time on, you and your project member won't be able to access the related tenants and cloud resources anymore. Furthermore, you can't create a project with the same identifier until the operator has completed the deletion process.

### Fix GCP Cost Collection
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** kraken-worker


#### Description
There was an issue with GCP cost collection, that was caused by infrequent gaps in GCP data delivery.
A mechanism has been introduced to prevent this in the future and make GCP cost collection more
robust against irregular data delivery.

### Bug related to Project-Dashboard-Button fixed
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
We fixed a Bug related to Project-Dashboard-Button. It was possible to click on a button even if the button was disabled and then a blank screen appeared.

### Improved error messages
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>**Component:** web

Partners and Platform Operators can now directly see on the Partner Dashboard whether pending quota requests exist.

### Username can be modified after creation with IdP property
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
When a user was newly invited/created its username can now be set after a property found in the AAD. The set username
can be modified by the rules of a printf string pattern. This is helpful in environments where the username should
be set to something different than the email address.

### Update Tenant Quota as Partner / Platform Operator
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
New Tenant Quotas cannot only be requested by meshCustomers, but also Partners and especially Platform Operators
can now update tenant quotas directly. They don't require a meshCustomer to create a quota request first anymore.

### Assign meshCustomerUserGroups to meshProjects
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
It is now possible to assign meshCustomerUserGroups to meshProjects
via the meshObject API. meshProjectGroupBindings can be imported which
specify the meshProject and the meshCustomerUserGroup as well as the
role that should be used for the assignment.

### Replicate member removal from group to meshIdB
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
After a member is removed from a meshCustomerUserGroup all relations between the user and the customer will now be updated in meshIdB. That fixes some edge-cases where access to OpenStack and AWS was still possible after removing a member from a group.

### Filter meshTenants by platform via API
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
We added platform filtering to the meshApi for meshTenants. You can use the API to filter meshTenants by their platform identifier to e.g. get a list of all Azure subscriptions.
Platform identifiers can be found in Administration > Platforms > Platform Instances > Platform Identifier.

### Multiple LDAP entities as source for meshObjects
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** identconnect

### Fix Tenant Details for some Partner roles
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
There was an issue when accessing the tenant detail screen in the Admin Area as a Platform Operator
or Replication Operator. This has been fixed now.

### Absent tag won't violate meshPolicy rule
**Audience:** Partner, Customer, Operator<br>**Component:** rn


#### Description
We altered the evaluation of meshPolicies in a way that two meshObjects are now compliant to a
meshPolicy rule if they both do not have the tag set, that is specified in the rule. This does
not apply if the tag is set, but contains an empty value.
This change will not lead to non compliant assignments of meshObjects because meshObjects that
need to be protected have a tag specified. This change only applies to meshObjects that both
don't have a tag specified which is in scope of a policy.
E.g. if you want to prevent a production Landing Zone from being used by a dev meshProject just
assign a production tag to the Landing Zone and create a meshPolicy that checks the meshProject
on a production tag. If the meshProject is not tagged in this case but the Landing Zone is, the
meshPolicy will prevent the meshProject from assigning the Landing Zone.
If you have doubts or questions about this change please reach out to us and we will assess
your setup.

### OpenStack federated IdP integration
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
A new mode is available for OpenStack integration. meshIdB is not required for the integration anymore. You can directly integrate your company-wide IdP to OpenStack. meshStack will make sure that users have access to the OpenStack projects they are assigned to in meshStack.

### Handle AWS metering edge-case
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>**Component:** kraken


#### Description
In AWS Cost and Usage Reports, the AWS Registrar product had in rare cases usage dates that were
outside of the billing period. It seems to be the only product in AWS with such an edge-case. We now handle
this case correctly and charge those costs in the same month as AWS did.

### Additional check against duplicate Blueprint assignments
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Adds a safety check to explicitly prevent duplicate Blueprint assignments before updating an Azure Blueprint.
Please note that there are already countermeasures against this condition in place and this is only an extra
safety enhancement for older blueprint assignments.

meshTenants have been updated with their correct localId.

### Fix for meshCustomerUserGroup assignment
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** releasenotes


#### Description
There was a problem in the assignment of meshCustomerUserGroups
to meshProjects, that occasionally prevented the creation of new
assignments. This issue has been removed.

### Improve termination status for OpenStack cloud resources
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** kraken


#### Description
As a Partner and via the API it is possible to retrieve a list of cloud resources (currently only OpenStack Nova Servers).
This list only contained a termination date of the resource to identify it as terminated. An OpenStack
VM can also be in an error state and already deleted, but it doesn't have a termination date. To be able
to still identify it as Terminated, we added a new status to cloud resources that can be 'Active' or 'Terminated'. This
is provided via the API and is considered accordingly in the Resource Inventory screen in the Admin area.

### Updates Azure Subscription creation API to latest version
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description

view within the Platforms section. The deletion process has been corrected,
so removed meshTenants would no longer show up there.

### Increased maximum message length
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Messages to meshCustomers sent by Partners can now be longer than before. The new maximum length is 2000 characters including spaces.
For longer messages we also added a "Read More"-Button for a better reading experience.

### Fix expired access screen
**Audience:** Partner, Customer, User<br>**Component:** releasenotes


#### Description
The expired access view received an overhaul. Now it also shows the name of the meshProject that
has expired user/group bindings when displayed on the Expired Access screen for customers.

### Improve responsiveness of meshCustomer list view
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** releasenotes


#### Description
The performance of the meshCustomer list view has been improved so
the table of meshCustomers will load faster initially and fetch
further meshCustomers with a shorter delay as well.

### Error message for non-existing Azure Management Groups
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Azure's API response is better handled to signal the user that either the required Management Group is
missing or that the replication process is unable to access the group. Both states are not 
individually distinguishable via the Azure's API response.

### Tenant Quota Management
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
meshCustomers can now request quota settings for their meshTenants. This is currently only supported for OpenShift.
Requested Quotas must be approved by a Partner, e.g. a Platform Operator. Approved Quotas will be enforced on every
replication of the meshTenant. When creating a new meshTenant, landing zone quotas will be applied as default tenant quotas.

#### How to use
When creating a project and selecting a Landing Zone of a supported platform, you will see a table showing you the landing
zone quotas that will be applied to the meshTenant. You can directly request higher quotas. The same is possible when
adding a location to an existing project. You can also create and update quota requests for existing meshTenants 
on the Project Edit screen.

meshPartners can approve or decline quota requests on the Platform Tenant screen. It is possible to filter on all meshTenants that
have pending quota requests.

### Versioning and new path structure of API
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Our new API structure supports versioning via custom Media Types in the "Content-Type" and "Accept" headers.
The meshObject Import as well as meshObjectCollection creation and deletion now support this new structure. The URLs
also slightly changed. The previous endpoints are still available untouched, but are deprecated now and not documented
anymore. They don't require the new headers. Your existing integrations won't break! But please move to the new
endpoints eventually. We will remove the deprecated endpoints during the year and new functionality will only be
supported for the new API. Information about the deprecation timeline will be send out to you. Please don't hesitate
to contact feedback@meshcloud.io if you have any question or remark.

#### How to use
When you call an API endpoint you have to provide a Content-Type header like
"application/vnd.meshcloud.api.meshobjects.v1+yaml" if the request contains a body. If a response body is provided
by the endpoint, you have to provide an according media type in the "Accept" header. You can find in the API
documentation which media types are required for which endpoints.

With this release we have improved the ability of the applications to successfully recover from this problem.

### Removing of company/billing address
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
With this release we deprecate the address concept in meshStack. Therefore you don't need to provide addresses anymore during customer or project creation. Previously a billing address and a payment method were required to create meshProjects on a meshCustomer. With this change a payment method suffices and enables a compliant charging of cloud usage and cost. The "Billing Address" and "Company Address" panel items are removed. The columns providing the address information in the project and quota csv export file are removed as well. Furthermore the addresses aren't required via the meshCustomer and the externalRegistration endpoint anymore. We still allow for any requests providing an address but the address information provided will not be considered anymore.

### Fixes failing detailed tenant usage report generation

It occurred if multiple projects were assigned to the same payment method.

### Gauges implementation for metrics based marketplace metering
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You now have the option of charging a marketplace service instance usage based on gauge metrics. Any resource usage that can both increase
or decrease can be modeled as a gauge metric. Some examples would be current hard disk usage by a database instance,
or the number of users currently registered to use the service instance. The final charges for this kind of resource
usage will appear as line items in the tenant usage reports.

#### How to use
The service definition in the service catalog needs to be extended to indicate that metrics are supported, and you have to implement a service
that would expose the gauge metrics. More details can be found in the
<a href="https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.meshmarketplace.metrics-metering.html#gauges">public documentation/a>.

### Fix Marketplace metering periodic counter implementation
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** releasenotes


#### Description

**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** rn


#### Description
The possibility of charging resources consumed by service instances by exposing metrics
from the service broker has been extended to also support sampling counters in addition to the
periodic counter metrics that have been released before.

#### How to use
One example use-case for the sampling counter would be an API Gateway Service where you would like to charge the service
usage based on the number of API requests executed while you only keep track of the total requests made.
Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.meshmarketplace.metering.html">Marketplace metering </a>
section in the public documentation for the details on how to extend your service broker to expose metrics.

### meshProject tags are now optional during import

### meshCustomer Deletion
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to delete a meshCustomer. The deletion can be performed only by the Customer Owners! Before a
meshCustomer is deleted, a check is performed to make sure all meshProjects and published Service Brokers have been
deleted. meshCustomers will be soft-deleted, so meshPartners can still see deleted meshCustomers and their events as
well as payment methods in the Admin Area. Deleted meshCustomers and meshPaymentMethods will be highlighted accordingly.

#### How to use
As a Customer Owner, you can find the new "Delete" button on the "General" screen in the Customer Area. You will
be asked for confirmation and a deletion reason when you click the button.

### Look up tag name availability upfront
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** releasenotes

The dropdown for looking up meshUsers / meshCustomerUserGroups
on the Customer Access Control screen sometimes showed duplicate items.
The lookup process was improved to prevent that.

### Always apply user default tags
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Default Tags for users can be configured in meshStack. They can be used to e.g. provide access for every user to
dev and qa environments, but not to production. Production access would only be provided to specific user groups.
These default tags are now applied on every startup of meshStack. Adding or changing default tags will therefore apply
always directly to all active users in meshStack.

### Unified meshUser & meshCustomerUserGroup policies
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
meshUser/Group can now be selected as a policy subject instead of meshUser and meshCustomerUserGroup
on their own. Both types have to be handled in the same way, because both can be assigned to meshCustomers
and meshProjects in the same way. An example for this is restricting access to production projects to specific users and groups. If the policy would only apply to groups, you could still assign any user, which wouldn't make sense.

### Fixed approval links for already logged in users
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Given a user who is already logged in to meshPanel and using a meshCustomer. Now she receives a Role Request Approval Email for another meshCustomer. This leads to an error when clicking the "Approve" link in the email. This has been fixed now and the approval request can be accepted successfully.

### Missing but configured tenant tags breaking replication
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** repli


#### Description
If a tag was configured to replicate as a platform tag but this tag
was missing on the meshProject (what can happen, since some tags are optional), 
this leads to failed replication. Now missing tags are just ignored.

### Retry mechanism for AWS cost collection
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** kraken


#### Description
In the past the cost collection process on AWS for metering was vulnerable to occasional
IO failures while downloading data. We introduced an improved retry mechanism that improves on
robustness and performance in such cases.

### Marketplace metering periodic counter implementation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack previously supported charging marketplace service instances based on the running time of the service instances.
With this feature, you have the possibility of charging other resources consumed by service instances by exposing metrics
from the service broker. We will support periodic counter metrics with this release, and other metrics such as gauges and
sampling counters will be included in future releases.
Periodic counters can be used to model any resource consumption that can be counted over a period.

#### How to use
One example use-case for the periodic counter would be an API Gateway Service where you would like to charge the service
usage based on the number of API requests executed.
Another use-case would be to charge the service usage based on an invoice. This is useful if the service is provided by a third party.
Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.meshmarketplace.metering.html">Marketplace metering </a>
section in the public documentation for the details on how to extend your service broker to expose metrics.

### Fix duplicate group suggestions in Project Access Control
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
It could be the case that duplicate meshCustomerUserGroups were suggested within the drop-down during the project creation access control. Now, each meshCustomerUserGroup will be included one time.

### Restrict landing zones to meshObject API use only
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to restrict a landing zone to be used only by meshObject API users. This means that Customer Admins are
prohibited from creating a new Tenant in the meshPanel using the given landing zone. The landing zone will also not be
visible for Customers.

#### How to use
Please keep in mind that this functionality requires an additional authority on the API user.
However, we have already enabled this for now for existing meshObject API users.
Marking a landing zone as restricted is possible in the meshPanel in the Landing Zone creation/edit screen for Partners.

### Multiple members of a group can now approve role requests
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Previously only one user from a meshCustomerUserGroup was able to approve a binding request. Now every user who is assigned to a meshCustomerUserGroup with role Customer Admin or Customer Owner can approve binding requests.

### Display Payment Method status
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** releasenotes


#### Description
There is a new screen in the partner administration area that lists all
payment methods for the partner and its managed customers. For each payment method
that has a limit defined, a progress bar is shown indicating to which degree the
available budget has been consumed so far. Payment methods can be filtered by several
criteria. The payment method screens in the customer account area have been reworked
to match the new functionality as well.

### Reporting period always goes until end of month
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the tenant usage reports, the end date for the current reporting period was previously changed incrementally by hour.
As an example, if you looked at the report during the month you would have seen that the report is for a period starting from
the beginning of the month until the current time. This has been changed so that you will always see the end date
of the full reporting period.

### Reduces memory consumption during GCP cost item collection
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** billing


#### Description
Fixes a condition responsible for excessive RAM usage
during GCP cost item collection and therefore could cause an out of memory
condition preventing the cost item collection.

### Fixes spelling error in Project Access Control
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The table in the Project Access Control showed 'User Group', which included single users as well. Therefore it is renamed to 'Users/Groups'.

### Add support for email addresses with long domains
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Users with email addresses ending in long domains were being rejected.

### Improves assigned Azure Blueprints detection
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Previously if a Blueprint was set up with the wrong cased typing in a Landing Zone, an existing assignment
was not correctly detected and meshStack tried to re-apply the Blueprint. This resulted in a stuck Blueprint assignment.
meshStack now detects the assignment regardless of cases. It also adds a system remark to the
affected tenant replication to make the user aware of the condition.

### Enhance JSON Schema default value handling
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
When defining a JSON schema for the marketplace or for meshObject tags, values had been set to an empty string
in the past if the text was cleared completely. This is now limited to properties with a default value only.
Additionally only freetext widgets are considered. This is required as otherwise, the default value would be shown
again, when the freetext field is cleared. This is available since v7.44.0.

### Customizable Payment Methods
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Customizable Tags can now be defined on Payment Methods per meshStack instance. A JSON schema defines which fields
have to be entered for the Tags. Dependencies between fields, validation patterns, etc can be defined.
Additionally the required Payment Method field "Payment Method Type" has been removed. 
You can now tailor the payment methods to the needs of your organization. This is available since v7.44.0.

### Health endpoint improvement
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Operators can know request the system status, uptime, database connection and version.

### Makes meshLandingZone name available for tenant tagging
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** repli


#### Description

cloud tenant tagging mechanism.
For more information, please check the documentation on tenant tags.

### Displays description for Service Broker pricing
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
You can now write a description for the billing structure including pricing plans for each Service Brokers. This helps to provide additional
information about the plan costs.
This is property is not part of the OSB Standard but meshStack will read this field and display it in the service plan overview in the marketplace.
For more information see the meshMarketplace documentation.

### meshObject import API customer binding validation
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
In the meshObject import API, the validation of the customer type against the meshCustomerRole was missing when
creating meshCustomerUserBinding or meshCustomerGroupBinding.
For example, it was possible to assign a 'Partner Admin' role to a user or group within a customer that is not
the partner customer. This validation has now been introduced.

### Add your own group(s) to a new project
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
When creating a new project, you can now easily add meshCustomerUserGroup(s) that you are a member of to the project. This means you no longer have to search for your meshCustomerUserGroup(s) to assign it to the project.

### Optional Cost Center for meshCustomer Import
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
The attribute 'costCenter' on meshCustomer in meshObjectImport is now optional. No payment method is created, if the
cost center is not provided. A meshPaymentMethod can be imported explicitly via meshObjectImport. In future the
cost center will be removed completely on the meshCustomer import object, so it is marked as deprecated in the API docs.

### Improved error message for project access
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>**Component:** gcp


#### Description
Improves the error message which could appear on project access
if no user was found on the project.

### Removed dialog during project creation
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
We've removed the additional dialog to allow user/group access during the project creation. Now user/group will be automatically added to the table view.

### Fix case-insensitive current member determination
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** replicator


#### Description
Current members of a group in a cloud platform like GCP and Azure was not determined in a case-insensitive way.
That is an issue if the case of the email address in the Enterprise IdP was different from the one used in the platform.
This led to the user being assigned correctly in the platform, but access to the meshTenant via meshPanel
was not possible. This has been fixed now.

### Shows actual replicated platform tags
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>**Component:** web


#### Description
Since cloud platforms have different requirements for tag values, meshStack adapts
tag keys and values to the requirements of every platform. To give the user feedback about
actual replicated platform tags we now show these tags in the project edit screen, project dashboards
and also in the admin area in the tenant details view.

### Create, Change and Delete meshPolicies
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
meshPolicies can now be created, edited and deleted by partner admins in the partner area.

### Fix for meshObjectCollection deletion endpoint
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
A bug has been removed that would return a non-formatted error message
for the meshObjectCollection deletion endpoint. It appeared in case
a meshObjectCollection can not be deleted because it is not empty.

### Fix skipping approval for self-assignment
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
If 4 eyes-principle is activated in a meshStack instance and only two Customer Admins are assigned to a meshCustomer, one of them was able to change his/her project role without an approval from the other one. This behavior has been fixed so an approval is now necessary by the second Customer Admin.

### Declarative deletion of meshCustomerUserGroups
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
meshCustomerUserGroups that were part of a meshObjectCollection for a previous meshObject import call
will now be removed from the meshObjectCollection and deleted during re-import, if they are not specified again.

### GCP User lookup is now case-insensitive
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** replicator


#### Description
GCP always stores email addresses in lower-case. When users are looked up in GCP via their email address and the
enterprise IdP provided the email address in mixed-case, the lookup in GCP was not working correctly. This has
been fixed now.

### Fixes issue where Landing Zone couldn't be saved
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
There was an issue in the panel which resulted in the Save button being disabled in the "Edit Landing Zone" page
for Landing Zones which have meshRole to platform role mappings. This issue has been fixed.

### Set reply-to field for outgoing emails
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The mails sent via the configured SMTP server now allow to set reply-to address via config.

### Separate OpenShift/Kubernetes Product in Metering
**Audience:** Customer, Operator, Partner<br>**Component:** kraken


#### Description
Separate prices for Kubernetes and OpenShift can now be defined in meshMetering. The OpenShift logo is now shown on
Tenant Usage Reports and Chargeback Statements for OpenShift tenants (previously it was shown as Kubernetes).

#### How to use
The only change that must be applied to every meshImplementation is an update of the product price catalog for OpenShift.
The product's platformType must be changed from "Kubernetes" to "OpenShift". The rest will be handled by meshMetering.

### Add yourself to the project during project creation
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The project creation wizard now contains an "Add Myself" button on the "Project Access Control" page. This will add your user directly to the project after it is created. Please specify the role and optionally provide an expiration date for the access.
fill the User/Group field with your user details. With this feature you no longer have to search for your own user in the search box.

### GCP tag values properly lowercased
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** gcp


#### Description
GCP only allows lowercase tag values. Before this fix, uppercase letters were replaced with underscore,
now they are properly lowercased.

### Introduction of meshObjectCollections
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
meshObjectsCollections can now be used to manage ownership and to group together meshObjects when
using the meshObject API. There are two new endpoints to create and delete meshObjectCollections.
As of now, meshObjectCollections are in Beta state. Only empty meshObjectCollections can be deleted.
Deleting meshObjects within meshObjectCollections will be implemented at a later point in time.

### Fixes issue in "Send Meessge to Users" functionality
**Audience:** Partner, User<br>

#### Description
There was an issue in the "Send Meessge to Users" functionality which is accessible for Partner Admins via the
"Send Message to Users" button on the "Customers" page. The issue was that the messages were not being shown to
the users when they logged into the meshPanel. This issue has been fixed and  the users will see the messages sent
to them when they login to meshPanel or switch between meshCustomers.

### Introduces new Customer Owner role
**Audience:** Partner, Customer, Operator, User<br>

#### Description
A new role "Customer Owner" has been introduced in meshStack. A Customer Owner currently has the same
rights as a Customer Admin, but there are plans to give this new role higher authority in the future.
There can be a maximum of two Customer Owners on a meshCustomer and this role can only be assigned to users and not groups.
The Customer Owner role should be assigned to the person/people who are mainly responsible for the meshCustomer and will
act as the point of contact for any incidents or queries.
The default user role assignment that is created when a customer is registered via the panel or the
<a href="https://federation.dev.meshcloud.io/docs/index.html#resources-externalRegistration">externalRegistration API</a>
will from now on be a Customer Owner assignment.

#### How to use
If there is no Customer Owner currently assigned, the Customer Admins can assign a new Customer Owner. If a Customer Owner
already exists on the meshCustomer, only they can assign or unassign a Customer Owner. Even if 4-eye-principal verification
is enabled, it is skipped when a Customer Owner assigns another Customer Owner.

### meshTenant fees for GCP tenants
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** tentacle-gcp


#### Description
Operators can now set a tenant fee on GCP projects via a price catalog setting.

### Fails replication for user/group reconciliation errors
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** gcp, azure


#### Description
If there is an error during user/group reconciliation for Azure and GCP projects the 
replication of this projects will now signal a properly failed replication.

### Set-up access control during project creation
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
The project creation process is extended with an additional access control page.
This means you can now decide which users and user groups will be included in the project before saving the new project.
The creator will also no longer be included by default. Please add yourself explicitly if you want to add yourself to the project.

### Skip Azure Cost Collection for deleted subscriptions
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** kraken


#### Description
Azure sets subscriptions to a DELETED state, before it actually deletes subscriptions. Cost data cannot be retrieved
for these subscriptions anymore. This is now handled correctly in meshMetering. There are also DISABLED subscriptions
in Azure. Subscriptions in that status can be reactivated again. Azure keeps subscriptions in that state for up to
90 days, before it actually sets them to DELETED state. Cost data of DISABLED subscriptions
will still be collected, so meshMetering still knows about the latest cost information Azure provides for DISABLED subscriptions.
Additionally Azure cost data collection is now more tolerant and won't stop completely if cost data collection only
fails for a few subscriptions. That way Tenant Usage Reports for all other subscriptions will still be generated
and are up-to-date.

### Fixes 'required' being shown multiple times for tags
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
We recently introduced a textual indicator to show that a tag is a required field.
In some cases this text would be appended multiple times and this is now fixed.

In order to make debugging of failed GCP Cloud Functions easier, the response of these failed
functions is now logged better and displayed in the Admin Area.

### Tag sanitization for cloud platforms
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>**Component:** repli


#### Description
meshStack now sanitizes project tags to the requirements of cloud platforms
instead of failing the replication.
This means when an invalid tag value or key is encountered it replaces invalid characters or
limits the length of the tag keys/values.
The limitations of each cloud platform and which transformations are automatically applied is
described in https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.tag-schema.html#tags-in-cloud-tenants

### Import payment methods via meshObject API
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed

Because of a misleading HTTP return code from GCP API the replicator was unable
to create groups with the new non-domain-delegated service account. This was fixed.

### Readable error messages for meshObject API
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
The meshObject API will return a dedicated error message in
case an invalid identifier is provided or meshProject creation
fails due to exceeded quota settings.

### Improves roles detection for Azure Blueprint assignments
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
On some occasions Azure does not return a role assignment properly even though it already exists in the scope of a Subscription. 
This adds a fallback way of checking for this role assignment in order to detect it and thus not fail the Blueprint assignment.

### OpenShift platforms with pre-provisioned users
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** replicator


#### Description
OpenShift clusters using an Identity Provider for example an Active Directory for user authentication are now supported
by meshStack. Users will be looked up via their external user id as it is done in public cloud platforms
like Azure already. The support for using meshIdB as an IdP in OpenShift has been removed with this change.

### Removal of GCP service user impersonation
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** gcp


#### Description
Previous versions of meshStack GCP project replication required Google Admin SDK permissions which were
only available by impersonating a dedicated service user. Google recently made these permissions
available to GCP Service Accounts. meshStack now integrates with Admin SDK using this new facility
and all configuration options for service user impersonation were removed.

#### How to use
You need to adapt the Service Account setup in order to not break GCP replication for existing
meshStack installations. Please follow this procedure:

1. Attach the "Group Admin" Role to the existing Service Account.
2. Upgrade meshStack installation.
3. Remove the the Service User in Google Cloud Identity Directory which was impersonated before.
4. Remove the Automated OAuth consent in the G Admin Console for the meshstack Service Account.
5. Disable the ???G Suite Domain-wide Delegation??? on the existing GCP Service Account in Google Cloud Console.

### Prevent finding disabled/deleted subscriptions
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Prevent the Azure Replicator from picking up a wrong Subscription when using the
Subscription name for filtering. This could happen if a deleted or disabled
Subscription already exists with the same name. (e.g. because a meshProject is created
with an identifier that has been used before)

### Fix all users screen
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Previously users assigned to a meshCustomer only via a group where not shown in the 'All Users' screen. Now we list those users as well.

#### Description
This fixes a bug which let the Azure user replication fail when no explicit Marketplace configuration was present.

### UI Changes on Customer Administration Page
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
On the customer page in the ???Administration??? area, we moved the ???create customer??? button to the top. Furthermore,
we improved the search capabilities by breaking down the search fields on the name, tags, identifier column.
Additionally, we now aggregated the export functionality in one ???Export??? button on top. The button includes a
drop-down showing the customer, project, and quota export to pick from.

### Hierarchical folder assignment in GCP
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** deployment


#### Description
The platform configuration has now the option to allow or disable hierarchical folder assignment in GCP. This means projects can be assigned to sub folders of the defined resource manager folder in a landing zone.

### Restrict assignment of Customer Admin via the meshPanel
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
The meshStack configuration has a new boolean flag 'restrict-customer-admin-role-assignment' which fully restricts
setting the Customer Admin role via the meshPanel, meaning only the API can be used for doing so.
Additionally, the 'Add Myself' button will now always add a Partner to a Customer with the role 'Customer Employee',
instead of 'Customer Admin'.

### More tolerant Group member replication
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** replicator


#### Description
Users are assigned in some cloud platforms via groups (e.g. GCP, Azure). One group exists for every project role.
If updating members of a group fails, we now proceed with the next group and replication goes on. Previously replication
failed at that step. Now only a remark on the tenant replication is written, so operators can see which exact error
occurred during group member replication. With this change, only the affected group is degraded as a change of members
is not reflected in the cloud platform. But all other groups and other replications steps are still executed successfully.

### Introduction of Landing Zone Tags
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Operators can now tag landing zones during the creation and edit process.
The applied tags will be shown during the project creation and project update. Tags can be customised
per meshImplementation. By default no tags are defined.

### Visibility of customer tags
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
We now show tags set on meshCustomers in the meshPanel. In the partner area tags are shown in the new tag column the
customer view. Furthermore on the meshCustomer level tags are shown in the administration area in the ???General??? page.
We replaced the previous ???Dashboard??? view with the ???General??? page to provide you with basic information of the
selected customer. The new home screen which shows the available projects in a selected customer now shows the central
customer information including tags as well.

#### Description
meshTags on customer user groups can now be imported into meshStack via meshObject API.

### meshCustomer import supports tags
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshCustomer import (see API docs) now has support for inserting, updating and deleting tags.

### Allow tags to take in multiple values
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshstack system is refactored to take in multiple values for tags. 
One use case would be to have multiple values for the "environment" tag eg.
"dev", "qa" and/or "prod" on a meshCustomer.
"environment" to allow values "dev", "qa" and/or "prod" on e.g. a meshCustomer. This means operators can now alter their JSON schemas and include
a multi-select input. The replicator for projects also makes sure that these tag values are correctly replicated to the respective platform tenant.

### Avoid unnecessary GCP billing account assignment updates
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** replicator-gcp


#### Description
GCP replication now avoids issuing unnecessary updates to GCP project's billing account assignments.

**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Azure Blueprints that are assigned multiple times to a subscription are now supported. This can happen when e.g. the
blueprint was assigned manually in Azure Portal or when the blueprint was already assigned when it was imported
to meshStack. Previously the duplicate assignments led to an always pending or failed replication. With the change,
the additional, manually created assignment will remain untouched.

### Fix for AWS token timeout during metering data collection
**Audience:** Partner<br>

Also the resulting error message was improved to hint for this error.

### GCP Service Account Hardening
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** gcp


#### Description
This release introduces a change to the GCP Service Account configuration that enables improved security hardening.
Please consult the details of this release note for upgrade instructions.

#### How to use
The meshStack replicator now uses the `meshfed-service` Service Account instead of the impersonated `meshfed-service`
Google Cloud Identity Directory user for all GCP API operations. This requires that operators assign the `meshfed-service`
GCP IAM role to the Service Account before upgrading to this meshStack version. After the upgrade is completed, operators
should remove the GCP IAM role assignment from the previous user.

We also recommend that operators familiarize themselves with the updated GCP Integration section of the product
documentation to take advantage of improved security hardening measures.

### Reduced data collection for AWS metering
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description

**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** aws


#### Description
Custom role mappings for meshRoles to AWS roles, which can be configured in a Landing Zone, were not applied correctly.

### Project deletion confirmation
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
As a partner or platform operator you can now review project deletions that require manual deletion.
You can view such projects in the deleted projects page in the administration area.
After performing the manual tenant deletion in the respective platforms, you can click on the trash icon to confirm that the project has been deleted.
The project will later be picked up by a job that will free up the project identifier that was being used by the project.

### Scrollable navigation dropdowns
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The recently added unmanaged tenants view in the Administration area now also includes AWS tenants.

### Filtered GCP billing data collection
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
GCP billing data collection query now filters data on the partition date.
This results in the BigQuery partitioned table support being utilized, which reduces the amount of data processed
by the query and reduces the cost of billing data collection.
Furthermore, the billing data collection can now be filtered by configuring meshStack with an
additional filter. This feature can be used if you want to collect billing data only from a given GCP organization or
folder.

### See unmanaged Azure tenants in Administration area
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
The Administration area has a new view, showing unmanaged Azure tenants. By unmanaged we refer to any tenants that are not
known to the meshcloud platform. In the future, more cloud platforms will be supported for this functionality.

### Better formatting for amounts rounded down to zero
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Monetary amounts less than 0.005 used to be rounded down to zero and was shown as 0.00 in chargeback statements and
usage reports. Now they are shown as <0.01. For example, if the amount is $0.004, it will be shown as <$0.01.
With this change, the user can clearly identify between amounts that are actually zero and very small amounts that would
have been rounded down to zero.

### External Customer Registration Url
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
Operators can now configure an external customer registration URL for meshPanel.
This configuration option replaces the previous "disableRegistration" setting
that required setting external registration URLs in meshPanel html templates.

#### How to use
This configuration option is useful for operators that want to disable self-service
meshCustomer registration from meshPanel and instead opt to provide their own registration
workflows using an external portal or ITSM tool.
This updated configuration approach simplifies maintaining meshPanel html templates for your
meshStack implementation. Please review the meshStack operator documentation for more details.

### Overview of Customer User Groups
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
All user groups for a meshCustomer can now be viewed under the Account section.

tags, technical attributes or ownership information.

### Multiple customer roles assigned to user
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Now the same user can have multiple customer roles assigned on the same customer. A user that is assigned multiple roles
will receive the combined privileges of the roles.
If the meshObject API is used to create multiple meshCustomerUserBindings for the same user and customer with different roles,
that user will be assigned all those different roles within that customer.

#### How to use
Login as a partner or customer and select Account. Click on the gear icon on the top right corner.
Select users from the left sidebar. Under the users section, you can now assign multiple roles to the same user.
The different user role assignments are currently reflected in different rows.

#### Description
Tenant list now shows totals per replication status based on applied filters (if any filters are used).

### Provide AWS and GCP access without meshPanel login
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
So far users always had to login at least once to meshPanel before they were able to access tenants in the cloud
platforms. For Azure and GCP, access is now granted directly to users that are imported via
meshObject import, if an euid is set for these users via the import.

### GCP replicator removes initial project owner roles
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** gcp


#### Description
Projects created by the GCP replicator contain a default ???owner??? role binding for the
meshfed-service user. A change to IAM policy reconciliation behavior introduced in meshStack v7.15.0 caused
these default role bindings to be no longer removed during reconciliation. This release fixes the behavior
to remove default role bindings during reconciliation.

#### How to use
This issue only affects GCP projects created by meshStack versions >= v7.15.0 and before this release.
GCP operators do not need to take manual action, meshStack will remove any default role bindings during
the next project replication.

(OpenStack virtual machines initially) and their corresponding customer, project and platform if they have any.

### Fix access to services running in custom domains
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** all


#### Description
There was an issue building up connection from meshStack to services running in non-standard domains. E.g. a service
that is only running in an internal customer network on a customer-specific domain. The issue was related to certificate
validation of those services and is fixed now.

### Improved GCP Project IAM Policy Reconciliation
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Replication to GCP now reconciles role bindings for meshStack managed groups only.
This enables use cases where operators want to allow self-service IAM in GCP,
e.g. for working with ServiceAccounts or leveraging the Cloud IAM Recommender
("Over granted permissions").

#### How to use
This new default behavior improves alignment with meshStack's project replication for  
Azure and AWS. Before this change, meshStack's GCP replication did reconcile the whole 
GCP project IAM policy. With this change Operators now have more flexibility to setup
Landing Zones and IAM self-service. Our roadmap feature "meshStack Cloud Inventory" will
enable Operators to monitor & audit role bindings created outside of meshStack.

### Customizable payment method descriptions
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
meshPanel now supports configurable templates that explain users how to obtain payment methods
for their meshProjects. The templates appear in the project create wizard
and on the payment methods screen.

#### How to use
Operators can use this feature to better guide users on how to create and manage payment methods.
This is useful if your meshStack implementation requires payment methods to be supplied via a
third-party system (e.g. an ITSM). Operators can customize the template by configuring the 
`payment:payment-description` template in meshStack configuration.
For more details please consult the operator documentation.

### Improved Payment Method selection
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
The options shown when selecting a Payment Method in project create wizard and on
the project edit screens now include more details about the payment method, e.g. a cost center number.

#### How to use

`panel.ui.costCenter.alias` and `panel.ui.costLimitation.aliases`. For more details please consult
the operator documentation.

### Updated Account Settings Payment Methods List
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The payment methods screen in your Account Settings now always shows
a list of available payment methods. If enabled by your operators
you can edit the default payment method "Cost Center" on this screen as before.

### Self-Service Customer Registration Wizard Updates
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
The self-service customer registration wizard "Billing Information" step 
can now be disabled by operators. This is useful if no default cost center payment method
should be collected during registration. Now the wizard shows a new 
"Review & Create" step as the final step of the process.

### Configurable GCP Project Id pattern
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Operators can now configure custom patterns for GCP Project Ids.
This is useful if operators want to enforce common project-id prefixes
or customize the length of included meshCustomer and meshProject identifiers.

#### How to use
For more details please consult the operator documentation.

### Avoid duplicate cost collection from AWS
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
In some cases cost lineItems from AWS have been processed multiple times
and lead to duplicated costs in usage report. This has been fixed.

### Consistently style forms containing metadata tags
**Audience:** User, Customer, Operator<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
Forms containing organization-specific <a href="https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshcloud.tag-schema.html">metadata tags</a>
like the project create wizard now style metadata tag form fields the same way as built-in form fields.

#### How to use
This change helps operators to provide a more seamless user experience for their meshStack implementations
when using organization-specific metadata tag schemas. This means Customer Admins won't see any difference between
e.g. meshProject core fields like "name" and any organization-specific metadata fields (e.g. a "product-id").

### Fixes edge-case during user assignment to AAD
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Improves internal error handling to avoid replication problems when a user is added to an Azure IAM backed platform
like e.g. a meshMarketplace.

### Fix edge-cases of user removal from meshCustomer
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
In some cases, like a user that was imported via meshObjectImport but never logged in and was invited to another
meshCustomer, deleting this new meshCustomer role request failed. This has been fixed. Those role requests can now
be revoked successfully from a meshCustomer.

### Option to disable user acceptance for invite
**Audience:** Customer, User<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
A configuration has been added to disable, that a user has to accept an invite to a meshCustomer.

Now the platform name is fully visible and not hidden by the replicaton status in low resolution screens.

### Customizable Connectivity Error description
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
A configuration variable defining the error message for connectivity errors was incorrectly marked as optional in the meshStack configuration model.
This could cause an "undefined" description message to appear in meshPanel.

#### How to use
Operators must now provide the mandatory `panel.ui.connectivityError` configuration variable. Please consult the documentation for more details.

### Deletion of projects with OpenStack Heat stacks
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description

This fix solves the problem of the AWS usage reports and future chargeback statement totals being incorrect.

### Assign default payment method to project on import
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With this fix, we assign the default payment method to the project when imported via meshObject import.

### Exclude configured Cloud Foundry organizations from metering
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With this feature, meshStack can be configured to not collect metering data from specific Cloud Foundry organizations.
If metering for a Cloud Foundry organization is disabled no usage reports will be generated for the spaces within those organizations.
There are Cloud Foundry organizations which are used only for the purpose of automated Cloud Fondry system tests.
One use case for this feature would be to exclude those organizations from metering.

### OpenStack VMs Public API

When used with an Enterprise IdP connected via LDAP, meshPanel could be configured to generate
password-based OpenStack RC files. This version of meshStack drops support for this option in
favor of always generating RC files using OIDC tokens.

#### How to use
Users that require using password-based RC files e.g. for service automation should use 
meshStack Service Users for OpenStack instead. This encourages better separation between
human and technical users.

### Improve Chargeback Statement Display
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The chargeback statement screen now shows placeholder rows for empty
reports, consistently shows totals below all tables and has more
consistent text-styling across the statmement.

### Introducing customer tags
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Tags can now also be defined on customer level. These tags are transferred together with the project
tags as parameters to cloud platforms when applying Landing Zones (e.g. when invoking an AWS
Lambda or an Azure Blueprint). They can also be defined to appear in Chargeback Statements.

### Mark sellers as out of scope
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Via configuration, it is now possible to mark sellers as out of scope. Once a seller is marked as out of scope,
the costs for that seller's products will be set to zero. The line items for the seller will appear in the usage
reports and chargeback statements with the "Out of Scope" suffix on the usage type. The total column for those line
items will be zero, but the used quantity will be shown correctly. This feature can be used for services for which
usage should be tracked but the chargeback process is not yet completely established.

### Signals error on non existing GCP Cloud Function
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>**Component:** gcp


#### Description
When a Cloud Function no longer exists (or the entered URL was wrong), the resulting error is now correctly reported to the user.

### Allow disabling of AWS Account Alias

#### Description
Azure Blueprint assignment lock modes can now be configured via landing zone configuration for each Azure Blueprint. Previously it was only possible to set the lock mode per Azure meshTenant.

### Relaxed Azure Subscription Role Assignment reconciliation
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** replicator


#### Description
meshStack now allows role assignments to exist on Azure Subscriptions that are managed outside of meshStack.
This is useful to create additional role assignments from Azure Blueprints or other Azure Services like DevOps Service Connections.

#### How to use
meshStack previously reconciled all subscription-level role assignments against the desired meshTenant state as derived
from the meshPlatform and Landing Zone configuration. This lead to a problem if third-party services want to create
additional role assignments. These role assignments were then deleted by meshStack during  reconciliation.
meshStack now ignores role assignments to principals that are not exclusively managed by meshStack (i.e. managed
AAD groups) and thereby leaves third-party role assignments intact. This gives operators more control but also more
responsibility to ensure now unwanted role assignments exist on managed subscriptions.

### Multiple Blueprints per Azure Landing Zone
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
It is now possible to assign multiple Azure Blueprints to a meshLandingZone.

### Improved Footer & Terms Link configuration

### Improved error logging for unexpected Cloud API responses
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
meshStack's internal error logging infrastructure now better separates
expected from unexpected Cloud Platform API responses. This improves log quality
and simplifies debugging of operational issues.

#### How to use
This change affects mostly affect Cloud APIs that meshStack expects to respond with HTTP 4xx
status codes during replication (Azure, OpenShift/K8s). From the perspective of meshStack's 
state reconciliation not all of these Cloud API responses represent errors requiring operator attention. 
Instead they may be part of expected Cloud API behavior, e.g. due to eventual consistency.

### Improved error messages during account import
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When performing an user, customer and project import the import process has been
improved to be more resistant against errors and will report improved error messages for

In particular they can explicitly configure new meshCustomers to require approval by their meshPartner
before the account is enabled.

#### How to use
Please see the documentation for a detailed list of the configuration options and their effects.
This change removes self-service verification of meshCustomer accounts using an email confirmation link sent to a
Customer Admin. We instead advise meshStack operators that allow self-service customer registration to 
configure either partner-approval or auto-approval for newly registered meshCustomers.

are configured for the installation.

### Enhanced OpenStack Server Metering Data
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
meshStack Metering now collects deleted server data from OpenStack. This improves accuracy of metering data
for OpenStack clouds that do do not provide Ceilometer/Panko telemetry.

#### How to use
Operators should be aware that collecting deleted server state data for the first time may result in increased 
load on the metering subsystem, as OpenStack Nova clouds do typically not purge/expire deleted server information.
This can result in collection of data about all servers that were ever deployed on a particular OpenStack cloud.

### Fixed usage calculation for preview

#### Description
Improves project replication handling to avoid project access to fail.

### Metering Resource Timeline Compaction
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshStack metering subsystem now automatically compacts resource timeline sample resolution
after a default offset of 30 days. Compaction increases processing performance of the system
and decreases storage requirements.

#### How to use
Operators can configure the offset per platform instance. When configuring this offset operators
must consider expected delays in metering data collection e.g. due to cloud platform failure and similar
conditions. It is not safe to insert data samples into compacted regions of a resource timeline,
so operators should chose the value to provide a good balance of performance and safety.

### Prefill CF marketplace parameters on instance update
