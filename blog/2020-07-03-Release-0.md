## Ticket Details
### Decoupling usage report generation from Azure VM collection
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes issue which prevented Azure tenant usage reports from being generated when Azure VM collection failed. Azure VM
collection is used for the Cloud Inventory feature and is not used for the purpose of usage report generation.
Because of that, with this fix, the tenant usage report generation process has been decoupled from the Azure VM collection
process.
