## Ticket Details
### Support data URLs in Service Broker images
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Service Brokers can provide images (i.e. icons) as metadata for their services. While regular URLs were already supported, images can now also be directly encoded as data URLs.

### Improved consistent display of date/time
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
Fixed some instances where times were not shown as user local time and made cases explicit where UTC times are used.

### Fix deletion of unpublished service brokers
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
The deletion of unpublished service brokers failed in some cases where service instances have already been provisioned.
This issue has been fixed.

### Enables Project Role approval process
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed, panel


#### Description
Operator can (optionally) configure the system to require an approval process when new project roles are assigned (or changed).
Another customer admin who exists can then approve the or decline this role request.
Additional information can be found in the <a href="https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.authorization.html">authorization documentation</a>.

### Platform notifications without time restrictions
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
Platform notifications can be created without setting a start or end date/time. Notifications without a start will be shown immediately and remain until they are deleted or updated if they have no end set.

### Display OS Licenses in Admin Area
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The used Open Source Libraries and Licenses for the Front- and Backend are now displayed via a link in the Administrator Area.

### Automatically redirect to IdP on Login
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Operators can now configure the login flow to automatically redirect to a specifc Identity Provider.
When enabled, users are directly redirected to the Identity Provider without having to enter their
email address or username first.

#### How to use
Operators can enable this setting by setting the `web.sso.kc_idp_hint` configuration flag.
This setting is useful when you're using a single Identity Provider only. Deployments integrating with
multiple Identity Providers should not set this configuration.

### Support for 'ExternalId' when accessing AWS Accounts
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** replicator


#### Description
Meshstack AWS Connector now supplies a configurable ExternalId when assuming roles in a managed AWS
Account from a privileged context. This improves security of managed AWS Accounts.

#### How to use
Operators need to add update meshstack replicator-aws service configuration and adapt their AWS IAM Policies to 
take advantage of ExternalId support.
More details can be found in the <a href="https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.how-to.integrate-meshplatform-aws-manually.html">documentation</a>

### Private service broker deactivating
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Customer can now deactivate private service broker. This action will deactivate all marketplace services and stop service catalog refreshing.
