## Ticket Details
### AAD users can be looked up by alternate email
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
When searching for a user to assign him/her to a customer and Azure Active Directory (AAD) is used for that lookup,
meshStack now also searches on the alternate email address for that user. In some cases only an alternate email
address and no primary email address is set in AAD. This can now be handled by meshStack.

### Improved replicator error message
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** replicator


#### Description
In case the platform configuration for the replication is missing or misconfigured,
an error message is shown in the pre-replication phase. The wording of this message has been
improved so it can be understood better.
