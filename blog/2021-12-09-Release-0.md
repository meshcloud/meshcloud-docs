## Ticket Details
### New template pattern interfering with config lib
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The parsing of config files by the used configuration library was
causing issues when setting up the latest placeholder templates for e.g. project name 
generation. This was mitigated by changing the placeholder pattern.

### Collapsible content in group detail screen
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When looking at the details of a meshCustomerUserGroup or meshPartnerUserGroup, the various content is now
in collapsible containers. This makes it easier to find the information you are looking for by hiding
some of the data that you are not interested in.
This is especially useful for (global) groups that are assigned to a large number of projects.

### Hide Payment Method tab for customer employees
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
As a Customer Employee, you won't see the 'Payment Method' tab in the project control plane anymore as this is only accessible for Customer Admins.
