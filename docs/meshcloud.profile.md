The following section covers all the relevant details regarding your Meshfed SSO Account.

## What is the Meshfed SSO Account?
We have invested a lot of work and time to enable a seamless Cloud experience across a large number of different Datacenter Locations and Cloud Platforms. To support the seamless access of all of our services across every datacenter location we rely on an Open ID Connect authentication flow.

## Profile

Navigate to the **Profile** Page via the navigation on the top right of the Meshpanel. Here you can find all your personal information stored in the Meshportal. You can also expand an area on the bottom of the page, that shows you all systems related to the Meshportal, that also persist your personal information. In general the Meshportal tries to store as little of your personal information as possible in the different systems.
