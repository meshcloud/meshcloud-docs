Within the Meshcloud platform we differentiate the following roles for users

## Customer Admin

Customers can create multiple projects and can have multiple customer employees \(users\) belonging to one company or one department. A customer admin can add users to a project via e-mail invite.

As a Customer Admin you can:

* Create projects on the platform
* Create users for your account
* Grant users access to specific projects
* Remove user access from specific projects
* Edit the company information of your account \(Company Address, Billing Address, Payment Method\)

## Customer Employee

Customer Employees need to be granted access to projects by an Customer Admin. They cannot create new projects or grant access to other users.

As a Customer Employee you can:

* Create and delete resources within the projects that you have been granted access to by a customer admin
