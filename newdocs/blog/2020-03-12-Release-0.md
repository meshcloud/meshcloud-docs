## Ticket Details
### Fix imported user login
**Audience:** User
**Component:** release-note


#### Description
meshcloud provides the possibility to onboard existing cloud tenants and users on meshStack via automated import. After the import users who were included in an import had problems to log into meshStack and the meshTenant. We resolved this problem. From now in it is possible to log into meshStack after the user import and in a second step into the meshTenant.

### Fixed missing service instance parameters
**Audience:** User
**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Service instance parameters are now correctly prefilled after an service instance update.
