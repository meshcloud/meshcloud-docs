## Ticket Details
### Fixes wrong auth token injection for Azure functions
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Fixes the wrong injection of an Azure function auth token, which was introduced via a previous simplification of token handling.

### Improved incompatible browser detection
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
A recent update for IE11 enabled it to erronously pass meshPanel's incompatible
browser detection. meshPanel now uses an improved JavaScript ES6 feature detection
algorithm to correctly identitfy incompatible browsers and inform the user with
a warning.
