## Ticket Details
### Increase retry timeout for AWS Control Tower deployment
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
The retry timeout for AWS Control Tower deployment has been increased from 15 minutes to 20 minutes.
This change is to accommodate the time it takes for AWS Control Tower to deploy resources.

### Improved Tenant Created Event Logging
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when tenants were created during Project creation, the tenant creation event was only recorded within the associated 
Project???s event log. In this release, tenant creation events are now logged separately, even when they are created as part of a 
Project.

### Live Updates for Building Block Status Now Available
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now see live updates for your in-progress building blocks automatically loaded on the tenant control plane. This ensures that you stay informed about the status of your orders in real time.

### Support Pinned Azure Devops Repositories in Building Blocks
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When using the Azure DevOps Building Blocks, pinning the version was not effective.
This means that if you used a repository with a specific version, it always used the default branch.
This issue has been fixed.

### Fix Error Messages Not Shown in Building Block Runs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
In some cases, building block runs failed without showing an error message.
This issue has been fixed.

### Make Terraform Runner timeouts configurable
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, only global timeouts were configurable in Terraform Runner and others were hardcoded.
Now, timeouts for terraform init command and terraform workspace operations are also configurable.
If you are running into timeouts during terraform init or workspace operations, you can now request an increase in timeout values.

### Multi-Select Dropdown for Status Columns
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A new multi-select dropdown has been introduced to enhance the user experience in the Admin Area across various 
pages, including Projects, and Payment Methods. This component allows users to efficiently filter and manage different statuses, 
providing a more streamlined and comprehensive overview.
