meshStack provides several APIs that can be consumed by third-party applications. This allows the integration of meshStack into established company processes provided by other applications. Typical examples include migration from legacy cloud management processes and integration with ITSM/CMDB Tools.

The API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.meshcloud.io/api/index.html), or in the menu at the top of this page under 'API Docs'. Please keep in mind that this documentation reflects the state of the latest meshstack version. If you want to make sure that the documentation reflects the state of the version of your own meshstack, refer to the built-in API documentation, which can be found in the footer of the meshPanel by clicking on 'API'.
