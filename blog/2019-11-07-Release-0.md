## Ticket Details
### AWS role policy mapping fully configurable
**Audience:** User


#### Description
The AWS roles can now have fully configurable policy mappings. This allows greater flexibility in role and policy assignments.

### Improves Landing Zone form input validation
**Audience:** Partner
**Component:** panel


#### Description
When setting up a Landing Zone for a platform the form validation is now more strict and prevents the input of
incomplete information. This could have led to an incorrect replication.

### Add `euid` to OSB Originating-Identity
**Audience:** Customer, User


#### Description
meshMarketplace also adds the `euid` to the X-Broker-API-Originating-Identity header.
This allows service brokers to use the external user identity (e.g. from Azure AD) for authentication or logging purposes.

#### How to use
The header contains a JWT. After decoding the JWT, you can find the `euid` in the `user_euid` JSON property.
