## Ticket Details
### Search for Tenants with pending Building Block Input
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
It is now possible to search for meshTenants that have missing Building Block
inputs. This enables Operators to quickly find the meshTenants, that require 
operator input for a Building Block. 
We added the link to the already filtered list to the notification email as well.
Additionally the Partner dashboard now also shows, if Building Block input 
is required.

### Sensitive Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** User, Operator, Partner


#### Description
Building Block Inputs can now be defined as sensitive. These inputs are encrypted by meshStack and can only be read
by the Terraform Runner, which actually executes Terraform Building Blocks. Sensitive inputs are entered via password 
fields in meshPanel and are only shown as ******, when they are displayed in meshPanel. With this feature it is now 
possible to securely use secrets via inputs in Building Blocks.

### Building Block log updates via refresh button
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, you had to switch the tab or do a full page reload to see the updated logs. Now, you can use the refresh button at the top.

### Fix setting Building Blocks to failed state
**Audience:** User, Partner


#### Description
When creating a Building Block failed multiple times, it is no
longer stuck in an infinite "pending" status. Instead a proper failed status 
is displayed in all Building Block views.

### Fix Deletion of Global Group
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, you were not able to delete the global group, if the 4 Eyes Principal is enabled in meshStack and pending requests for the assignment of this global group exist. This has been fixed now.

### Display UUID of added Building Block
**Audience:** Customer, Partner


#### Description
You can now see the UUID of the Building Block that has been added to the meshTenant. This UUID is especially helpful to operators as it will be used as a part of the key name for the Terraform Backend configuration.

### Extended SCIM 2.0 Integration
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
We improved our existing SCIM 2.0 integration to support both group and user provisioning.
Users can now be automatically created, updated, deactivated, or deleted in
meshStack after they have changed in AAD.

### Workspace support for Terraform Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
Each Building Block of type Terraform will now obtain an individual
Terraform workspace so that multiple Building Blocks won't share a common
Terraform state when the same remote backend is configured for them.
This behavior is currently not modifiable.

### Global groups created via SCIM are shown in Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, global groups created via SCIM were not visible in the Admin Area.
This has now been fixed.

### Fix meshPlatform Deletion Reason in Danger Zone
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, meshPlatform deletion reason was not shown in the deletion details in the meshPlatform control plane  'Danger Zone' tab.  This has been fixed.

### Extended meshPlatform Audit Logs
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
We have expanded audit logs for meshPlatform with creation, deletion, update, deprecation 
and reactivation events. So that now you have a full scope of meshPlatform audit logs 
to investigate important changes and act on them.

### Fixed Dashboard Flakiness
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
In the cases when you were switching from the Customer to Admin panel, 
the Financials overview on the Dashboard screen was not loaded. This is 
fixed now.
