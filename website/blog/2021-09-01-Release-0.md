## Ticket Details
### AWS Account Enrollment per LZ
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, account enrollment for AWS accounts to AWS Control Tower could be enabled on a platform level only.
With this change it is now possible to set a flag per Landing Zone to decide whether created AWS accounts of this
Landing Zone will be enrolled in AWS Control Tower or not. This allows platform operators to configure different behavior around account enrollment for a single platform.

### Prevent creation of tenants without a landing zone
**Audience:** Customer, Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
For platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP and OpenShift a landing zone is mandatory for a successful replication.
Tenants for these platforms can no longer be created if no landing zone is available. An according
info message is shown to the user in meshPanel.

### Fix replicated platform tags not showing for partners
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The replicated platform tags have not been shown to partners in the tenant detail screen.
This issue has been fixed now and the platform tags are shown correctly.
