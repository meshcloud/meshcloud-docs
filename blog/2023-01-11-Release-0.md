## Ticket Details
### Fix in the Financials section of the Admin Dashboard
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
The "Financials" section of the new dashboard in the Admin Area previously
included all costs, including those from tenants not managed by meshStack as
well as costs from private meshMarketplaces. For some customers, this has
resulted in unreasonably high cost numbers. That is why we now include only
costs from tenants that are managed by meshStack.

### Continue Chargeback for deleted Tenants
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, the chargeback statement generation was based only on existing tenant information
for the respective period. Now when you delete the tenant, the  chargeback statement process 
will incorporate chargeback statements for all related costs to a missing tenant as long as 
cloud costs still occur.
