## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to Email Branding Settings**
   - In **meshPanel**, go to **Settings → Appearance → Email**.

2. **Configure Email Identity**
   - Set **Internal Name** to a value of your choice, e.g. `Likvid Developer Platform`.  
     _This will appear as the "From" name in emails._
   - If desired, enable **Prefix internal name to all email subjects**.  
     _All emails will start with “Likvid Developer Platform” for consistency._
   - Set **Sender Email Address** to a value of your choice `likvid-developer-platform@likvidbank.com`.
   - Set **Reply-To Email Address** to  a value of your choice `likvid-developer-platform@likvidbank.com`.

3. **Apply Brand Visuals**
   - Set the **Email Header Logo** to a logo of your choice. This will be shown at the top of all emails.
   - Set the **Button Color** to your preferred color **Likvid Bank Blue** (`#0072C6`).
   - Set the **Button Text** to a call-to-action text of your choice, e.g. `Open Likvid Developer Platform`.

4. **Set Email Signature**
   - You can set an e-mail signature, including HTML, that will be added to the bottom of all e-mails. For example:

     ```text
     Best regards,
     The Likvid Developer Platform Team

     Need help? Reach us at <a href="mailto:likvid-developer-platform@likvidbank.com">likvid-developer-platform@likvidbank.com</a>
