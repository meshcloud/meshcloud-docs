## Ticket Details
### Communication Emails Use Correct Subject
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixed an issue where communication emails were not using the provided subject. Previously,
the system would always use the default subject, ignoring any custom subject. Now, if a custom subject is provided, it
will be used instead of the default subject.

### Fixed Issue Preventing Workspace Members From Adding Tenant Services
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue that could prevent workspace members from adding a service to a tenant they have access to. Workspace
members can now add and configure tenant-level building blocks as intended, enabling proper self-service access to
marketplace services for their tenants.

### New meshPlatformType API for Custom Platform Types
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshPlatformType API lets you manage custom platform types programmatically. This enables you to integrate
proprietary or emerging cloud platforms beyond meshStack's built-in types (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.). You can create,
read, update, list, and deactivate custom platform types via the API.

#### How to use
All API keys can read platform types. Creating custom platform types requires platform save permission.
Updating and deactivating them requires admin permissions. When you deactivate a platform type, existing platforms
continue to work, but new platform instances of this type cannot be created.

### Tag Validation for meshObject API Rollout Notice
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We are rolling out an important update to meshObject API tag validation behavior for admin permissions. Unless
already manually configured, existing meshStacks now default to the legacy tag validation bypass behavior to
preserve backward compatibility. Starting April 1st, 2026, all meshStacks must enforce full tag validation and the
legacy bypass setting will no longer be available.

#### How to use
Please review the [deprecation notice](https://feedback.meshcloud.io/deprecations/p/deprecation-bypassing-tag-validation-in-admin-api-calls)
for more details on this change and its implications.
We recommend reviewing your API integrations and disabling the bypass in the Partner Area under Settings >
Compliance > Tags once you've confirmed your integrations supply valid meshObjects that pass your configured tag
validation rules. You must disable the legacy tag validation bypass before April 1st, 2026. After that date, all
meshStacks will enforce full tag validation for admin API operations.

### Fix Double Encryption in Building Block Creation Via API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating Building Blocks via the meshObject API with sensitive static inputs defined on the Building Block Definition,
these inputs were being encrypted twice. This caused Building Block runs to fail because the double-encrypted values could
not be properly decrypted by the Building Block runner. This issue has been fixed.
Failed Building Blocks will be repaired by starting new runs.

### Event Logs for Payment Methods
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now create event logs for payment methods. When you create, modify, or delete a payment method, these changes
are now visible in the Event Logs section in the admin area. This provides you with better visibility and
auditability of payment method changes in your meshStack installation.

### Landing Zone Quotas are Now Available in the meshLandingZone API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshLandingZone preview API now exposes quotas configured for landing zones. This allows you to retrieve and
set resource limits (such as CPU cores and memory) for landing zones via the meshObject API. Quotas define resource
limits that will be applied to tenants using a specific landing zone.

#### How to use
When creating or retrieving a landing zone via the meshLandingZone API, the `spec.quotas` field now contains an
array of quota entries. Each entry has a `key` (the quota name) and `value` (the quota limit). For example, a
landing zone might specify `cpu: 10` cores and `memory: 20` GB.

Quota support is currently available for Kubernetes, OpenShift, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Cloud Foundry and 
OpenStack platforms. For platforms that do not support quotas (such as AWS, GCP, and Azure), the quotas field will 
be an empty array.

### Communication Center Now Part of Developer Portal Module
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have simplified our product modules by consolidating the Communication Center into the Developer Portal module.
Previously, the Communication Center was split between a "light" version in the Developer Portal and a "full" version
in the separate Developer Engagement module. Now, all Communication Center features are available to all customers
with the Developer Portal module enabled.

#### How to use
If you previously had the Developer Portal module enabled, you can now access all Communication Center features
without needing a separate Developer Engagement module license. This includes creating communications with action
required type, filtering by building blocks, workspace tags, and building block tags. No configuration changes are
required on your part.

### New Event Log Viewer Role for Read-Only Access to Event Logs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A new "Auditor" role is now available in the Admin Area. This role allows you to grant users read-only
access to event logs for audit purposes without providing full administrative permissions. Users with this role can
view all event log entries across workspaces but cannot modify any settings or perform other administrative actions.

### Fix Capitalization of meshStack in Page Titles
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We corrected the capitalization of "meshStack" in browser page titles across the entire application. Previously, some
page titles used lowercase "meshstack", which has been updated to use the proper capitalization.
It also adds german translations for previously missed page titles.

### Fix Issue with User Bindings on Workspaces
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We resolved a bug that prevented users to be assigned to workspaces correctly.
This was the case when SCIM was disabled, user invitation tokens were disabled as well and
an identity lookup was configured for your meshStack.

### Extend Admin Permissions on meshObject API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We elevated the admin permissions so they now enable management
of meshObjects on the partner workspace as well. This includes 
e.g. the management of meshPlatforms.

### Building Block Runner Selection in Panel
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Platform engineers can now select the building block runner for their building block definition version directly in
the panel when creating or editing a building block definition. Previously, meshStack automatically selected an
appropriate runner based on the implementation type. This manual selection allows you to choose between shared
runners provided by meshStack and dedicated runners hosted by your workspace for additional control and flexibility.

### Fix Metering Status Display After Platform Configuration Save
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where the metering configuration status was not properly updated in the meshPanel after 
saving platform configuration changes. Previously, the status would not reflect the current state until 
the page was refreshed.

### Streamlined User Access Editing with Modal Dialog
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the user experience when editing access permissions for workspaces and projects
in the new access control interface (access control v2). Instead of navigating to a separate
page, you can now edit user access directly in a modal dialog that opens on the same screen.

Note: This change only affects customers who have access to the new access control v2 feature.
If you are using the standard access control interface, this change does not apply to you.
