## Ticket Details
### Fix Error on Project Role Change
**Audience:** Partner, Customer


#### Description
Release v2025.10.0 introduced a regression that led to an error when a
project role was changed for a user or a group. This has been fixed.

### Improved Tag Representation
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We have improved the representation of the tags in the panel so 
that the screens no longer appear broken due to the length and 
quantity. The tags are now displayed in a table format, 
which allows for a more organized and structured view of the tags.

### Removed Tenants Column
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
We have removed the tenants column from the projects overview in admin area 
to simplify the view and make it easier to read.
