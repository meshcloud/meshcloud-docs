## Ticket Details
### Fix redirect from 'Manage' button in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
The 'Manage' button for managing your meshCustomer was broken and redirected to a non-existing page.
This has been fixed and the 'Manage' button will now redirect to the list of projects in the Account area instead.

### Introduced an identifier for meshLandingZone
**Audience:** User


#### Description
With this release, we have introduced an identifier that should be specified when creating a meshLandingZone.
This identifier cannot be modified after creation and will uniquely identify a meshLandingZone. This field will be
auto generated for existing meshLandingZones.
This was introduced to ensure consistency with other concepts such as meshProjects and meshCustomers which already have an identifier property.
