Tags are key-value labels used in meshStack to organize, categorize, and manage resources such as users and environments. They help teams add business context, enable reporting, and support automation by attaching metadata to cloud resources. Tags can be used for cost allocation, compliance, ownership tracking, and to drive policy enforcement across the platform.

Tags are visible throughout meshStack and can be referenced in policies to automate governance and ensure resources meet organizational requirements.
