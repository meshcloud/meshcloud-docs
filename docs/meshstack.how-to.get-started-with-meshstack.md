title: How to get started with meshStack
---

This how-to guide is targeted at Cloud Foundation Partners that are starting out with a brand new meshStack. It is intended to be the first resource you read. You need to be able to log into your meshStack to follow this guide.

## Step 1: Log into your meshStack

As a Cloud Foundation Partner you are directly forwarded to the admin area of meshStack. This is the cockpit that helps you stay in control of everything happening in meshStack.

This it what it looks like.

To return to this view, you can always press the "Admin Area" button in the top bar.

If you are not able to see this screen, you are missing partner rights. This can be fixed by any other partner user.

## Step 2: Create your first meshWorkspace

The workspaces of your Cloud Foundation are represented by meshStack as meshWorkspaces.

To experience what this feels like, create your first workspace via the panel. To open the wizard, click on "workspace +" as shown in the picture below.

Of course, this can also be achieved via API. Take a look at our [short API intro](./meshstack.how-to.create-workspace-via-api.md).

## Step 3: Create your first meshPlatform

As a Cloud Foundation Platform, meshStack allows you to offer self-service tenant management, chargeback and much more to your workspaces.

To start managing a cloud platform with meshStack, follow [How to integrate a meshPlatform into meshStack](./meshstack.how-to.integrate-meshplatform.md).


## Step 4: Create your first meshProject

After you onboarded your first meshPlatform, your Cloud Foundations' workspaces can manage their cloud tenants (Azure Subscriptions, GCP Projects, AWS Accounts) in meshProjects.

To experience how smooth the self-service experience is, create your first project via the panel. You might want to check out the [user guide](./meshstack.how-to.create-project.md) or a less than 4 minute [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYQa-WVtfDM).
