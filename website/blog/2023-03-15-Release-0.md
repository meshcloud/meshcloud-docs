## Ticket Details
### Create Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
As a Platform Operator or a Partner, you can now create a Building Block that requires manual provisioning.
These are Building Blocks, that are executed manually by the Platform Operator, who has to enter input
manually. Entering this manual input is not available yet, but will follow with the next release.
For now, Platform Operators can create Building Blocks and application teams can add these Building Blocks
to their tenants. The Building Blocks will remain in a PENDING state until next release. With the next release
they will then be processed.

#### How to use
Go to the "Building Blocks" section in the "Admin Area". Click the "Create Building Block" button and enter
all relevant Building Block data. This includes, which platforms this Building Block is available as well as
which input needs to be provided by the application team or by the operator.

### Add Building Block to meshTenant
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to also add new Building Blocks in the Tenant details screen on the Customer Panel. 
You can now add available Building Blocks to specific meshTenants to assure best practice resource usage, 
additional services to tenants, and more.

#### How to use
Go to the "Building Blocks" tab in the Tenant Control Plane and click "Add Building Block".
Now you can pick one of the available Building Blocks and provide input variables to those
Building Blocks, if needed.

### API User Self-Service with kraken support
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
API Users with billing permissions can now be managed from inside meshPanel.

### Cleanup outdated GCP permissions
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
After reconfiguration of meshRole to GCP role mappings, some old permissions may stay in the GCP. 
This is fixed now, and all outdated permissions will be cleaned up.

### Fixed payment method details budget chart
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We fixed the blank payment method details area chart. You can now see again 
the consumption of the current budget over time.

### Increases the limit of active payment methods to 350
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Due to certain use cases (e.g. one central meshCustomer), we increased the 
maximum allowed active payment methods from 250 to 350 per meshCustomer.

### Irreversible deletion of a meshPlatform
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We replaced the deactivation of meshPlatform in the Admin Panel with a deletion option. So when you choose a deletion option for a specific meshPlatform, you will not be able to choose it for new tenant creation. Moreover, after the meshPlatform deletion, you will not have access to related tenants via meshStack.
In contrast to deactivation, the deletion can not be reverted. Once you delete a meshPlatform, no replication will be executed, and you will not have any chargeback statements for related tenants.  However, you can still directly access the platform tenants in the cloud platform.

#### How to use
On the meshPlatforms screen on the Admin Panel, you could select the needed meshPlatform and navigate to the 'Danger Zone' tab. There you can either (un)do a deprecation or with a new option irreversible delete the meshPlatform.

### Fix meshProject stuck in pending deletion
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
If you deleted a meshProject that contains a meshTenant of a deactivated meshPlatform, 
your project remained in a pending deletion state. This is fixed.

### Cloud Universe Zoom in/out buttons
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
To make enhance your Cloud Universe exploration, we've added zoom-in/out buttons. You can now 
zoom in/out using the buttons or your mouse wheel.

### Building Blocks List
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We have introduced the first screen regarding Building Blocks. "Building Blocks" is a new concept that enables you to build a secure cloud landscape for different use cases in your organizations in a modular landing zone approach.
Please stay tuned, we will integrate step by step more building block related functionalities in the upcoming weeks.

### Introduction of Building Blocks for meshTenants
**Audience:** Customer, User<br>

#### Description
The "Services" tab on the tenant control plane is now renamed to "Building Blocks". This is one of the
first iterations we make to introduce building blocks. This is a new concept, that will enable
platform engineers to e.g. provide certain resources or configurations on top of your tenant,
by simply providing i.e. a Terraform Module.

#### How to use
The list on the "Building Blocks" tab is now capable of showing building blocks that were added to
the meshTenant as well as Service Instances from the meshMarketplace, that are bound to this meshTenant.
