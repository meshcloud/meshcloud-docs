Projects enable clear separation of environments—such as development, testing, or production—within a workspace, where platform resources are provisioned and managed. Each project belongs to a workspace and serves as a dedicated space for managing related resources, user access, and operational activities.

Projects allow you to:

- Organize and isolate different environments for your business applications.
- Manage user access to the associated tenants and resources within each environment.
- Gain financial insights into the costs incurred by the project, supporting budgeting and cost control.
