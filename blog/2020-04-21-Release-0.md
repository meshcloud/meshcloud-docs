## Ticket Details
### Fixes edge-case during user assignment to AAD
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Improves internal error handling to avoid replication problems when a user is added to an Azure IAM backed platform
like e.g. a meshMarketplace.

### Fix edge-cases of user removal from meshCustomer
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
In some cases, like a user that was imported via meshObjectImport but never logged in and was invited to another
meshCustomer, deleting this new meshCustomer role request failed. This has been fixed. Those role requests can now
be revoked successfully from a meshCustomer.
