## Ticket Details
### Fix Deleted Tenants Status
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, the displayed status of deleted tenants sometimes was shown "in progress" however tenant was already deleted. This is fixed now.

### Improved Project Overview screen
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We added an information to the Project Overview screen
in the Admin Area that shows the total amount of meshProjects
that match the current filters.

### Improves localId override during meshObject import
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, during meshObject import request meshTenant's localId could be overridden if the existing localId was 
different. Now the import of a meshTenant will fail with an error message explaining that the incoming localId is 
wrong and can not be processed.

### Fix project number on the customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, an incorrect number of projects is shown in the 'Projects' tab on the customer control plane, if you are a Customer Employee who is assigned directly and via a group to a project. This has been fixed.

### Bugfix in the Financials chart on the Dashboards screen
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The Financials chart has shown the value "undefined" instead of the correct
amount in some cases. This has now been fixed.

### Allows Single Quote Character in Emails
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes failing user imports or invites if a user had a 
single-quote (') character in the email address.

### Missing Payment Method notification improvement
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We improved the email for missing Payment Method notifications.
Instead of multiple times, the reminder text to assign a valid 
Payment Method now appears only once at the bottom of the email.

### Automatic cleanup of outdated access groups
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With this change, we introduce an automatic deletion of all outdated access groups in Azure, GCP, AWS and Azure Kubernetes Service. 
For example, when you change the group naming pattern on the platform configuration page, or change 
the assigned role of the group in the landing zone or platform configuration, the outdated access groups are 
automatically deleted and new groups are created using the updated group configuration.

### First Cloud Universe interaction possibilities
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We've implemented the first Cloud Universe functionalities to make it more interactive. 
You can now zoom in/out and move around Cloud Universe. Please stay tuned, as we will 
extend this tab with more information in the coming weeks!
