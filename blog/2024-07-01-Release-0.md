<!--truncate-->

## Ticket Details
### Fix nightly replication
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
Due to a previous bug that was present in meshStack since version 2024.28.1
the nightly replication of all tenants was not working as expected anymore.
This bug has been removed.
Also we fixed a case of tenants being replicated twice and the second replication
ending up with an error message "tenant failed to replicate".

### Restrict notifications for landing zone only building blocks
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
For landing zone only building blocks successful notifications are not sent anymore. Only the operator will receive notifications for failed building blocks or when an input is required.
