## Ticket Details
### Adds labels to OpenShift Namespaces/Projets
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>**Component:** repli


#### Description
Operator can define certain mappings in order to use properties of meshProjects as labels in OpenShift. See the OpenShift section in the meshStack documentation for more details.

### Clean up old metering raw data
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** kraken


#### Description
In order to handle large cloud platforms reliably in meshMetering, collected raw data from platform instances
is now deleted automatically after a configurable amount of days.

### Configurable Labels for OpenShift landing zone templates
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
An operator is able to define a set of standard labels to be applied for OpenShift template replication.

### Enables Labels in Landig Zone for OpenShift
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** repli


#### Description
Operators can now define custom labels in the configuration of a OpenShift platform in order to append these labels
to all user provided ResourceQuota definition files.

### More robust project access after an error
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** web


#### Description
If the last replication error was some time ago the panel will retry longer to await a new
project replication before retrieving the access. This will help to reduce the amount of
displayed out-of-date error messages during project access.
