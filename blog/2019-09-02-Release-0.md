## Ticket Details
### Fixed usage calculation for preview
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** kraken


#### Description
A preview of a usage report for the current usage period could result in considering resources that had already
been deleted. This was not an issue for finalized reports, that result in chargeback statements. It has now
been fixed for the current period preview.

### Fixed redirects for partners
**Audience:** Partner
**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Users assigned to a partner account have always been redirected to the administration area after login. They were not able to navigate directly to a bookmarked URL or e.g. to the accept invite link provided via mail. This has been fixed.
