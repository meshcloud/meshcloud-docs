## Ticket Details
### Improved URL validation for GitHub and GitLab integrations
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Integrations with GitHub and GitLab now sanitize and validate the provided URLs. This prevents issues with trailing slashes and whitespace ensuring more robust integration experience.

### Fix Saving of Building Block Sensitive File Inputs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A bug that was present since the v2025.28.0 release prevented the proper saving or updating of the sensitive
building block static file inputs.
They were incorrectly saved unencrypted and the building blocks did not run successfully. Please re-upload those
files and/or rotate the secrets associated with them.

### Fixed Chargeback Message for Excluded TURPs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, users would see a misleading message stating that "No tenant usage reports were recorded," which 
did not reflect the actual presence of non-finalized TURPs. In this release, the user interface now displays a 
clearer message in such cases, informing users that TURPs exist but were not finalized at the time of statement 
finalization.

### Communications Badge Count Not Updating
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a cosmetic bug that caused no immediate update of the 
badge count after the user acknowledged a communication.

### Search and filter workspace resources
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We enhanced the workspace resource overview with search and filtering capabilities. You can now quickly find 
specific resources by searching for their names and filter resources by type (Projects, Tenants, or Building Blocks) 
to focus on what you need.

#### How to use
Navigate to your workspace overview page where you'll see a search bar at the top of the resource grid. Enter any part 
of a resource name to search, or use the filter buttons on the right to show only specific resource types. You can 
combine search and filtering to narrow down results even further. The search works with partial matches and is 
case-insensitive for your convenience.

### Enhanced Building Block with Summary support
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building blocks now support a new "Summary" output type that displays markdown content directly in the building block 
details view. We've also streamlined the building block creation process to redirect directly to the newly created 
building block details page instead of the list view.

#### How to use
When creating building block definitions, you can now add outputs with the assignment type "Summary" to provide 
guidance and next steps to users.

### Building Block runners use external endpoints for callbacks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where Building Block runners were using internal endpoints, which caused problems when integrating with 
external systems that require callback URLs. This affected GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD pipelines, and asynchronous 
Terraform runs that needed to communicate back to meshStack.

### Overview for all resources in workspace
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
A new grid view displays all workspace resources (projects, tenants, building blocks) in a 
unified overview with visual relationship indicators within the workspace overview tab. 
Users can quickly identify connections between resources and navigate directly to related 
resources through clickable relationship badges.

#### How to use
Navigate to the workspace overview page to see the new grid layout showing all your workspace 
resources. Each resource card displays its type, name, and relationships to other resources.
Click on relationship badges to navigate to connected resources.

### User Permissions source for Workspace Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now support the "User Permissions" source for workspace-level building blocks. This provides all workspace users 
with their workspace roles as input data for your building block.

#### How to use
When configuring inputs for workspace-level building blocks, you can now select "User Permissions" as a source. This is 
particularly useful for building blocks that need to set up user access or permissions based on the workspace's user 
assignments. The user permissions data includes user details like username, email, and roles, making it easy to 
configure access controls or user-specific resources in your building blocks.

### Fix Communication Due Date
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, it was possible to change the due date of communications of type
Notification, although this was not intended. This has been fixed, such that due
dates can now only be specified and changed for Communications of type
'Action Required'.

### Extend Communication Status Filter
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when viewing the received communications within the workspace
area, filtering communications by the status 'Received' was not possible.
This has been fixed.

### Fixed Adding Users During Workspace Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fix addresses the issue where users could not be added during workspace creation.

### Resource links on building block cards
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building blocks now support Resource URL outputs that display as clickable links directly on the building block card. 
This makes it easier to access external resources and services provided by your building blocks.

#### How to use
When defining building block outputs, you can now select "Resource URL" as the output type. These outputs will appear 
as clickable links on the building block card with an external link icon. The display name you configure for the 
output will be used as the link text. You can define multiple Resource URL outputs for a single building block to 
provide access to different resources or dashboards related to your infrastructure.
