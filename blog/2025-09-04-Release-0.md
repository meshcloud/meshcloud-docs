## Ticket Details
### Remove Rate Limits on meshObject API in Production Environments
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The last meshStack release introduced API rate limits intended for evaluation in QA environments.
Due to a configuration bug these rate limits were also rolled out to productive meshStacks ahead of time and without proper calibration.

API consumers that were exceeding the rate limit have seen HTTP 429 responses in production environments. 
We fixed this now so rate limiting is only active in QA environments and will separately inform you about further rollout timelines and implications for production environments.
