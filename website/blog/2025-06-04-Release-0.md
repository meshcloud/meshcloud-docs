## Ticket Details
### Add new meshPaymentMethod endpoints in meshObject API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This release introduces POST, PUT and DELETE method support for meshPaymentMethod objects via the meshObject API
Platform teams and automation can now manage payment methods programmatically, enabling better integration and automation scenarios.

#### How to use
To use the new endpoints, refer to the meshObject API documentation for details on how to create, update, and delete
meshPaymentMethod objects. This release introduces new permissions for API Keys, allowing you to control access
to these endpoints. Permissions for creating, updating and deleting payment methods can only be assigned by admins.

### Improved building block grid view
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have slightly improved the design of the building block grid view in meshPanel.
The new layout simplifies adding a new building block. We also improved its layout for smaller viewports.

#### How to use
You can find the improved building block grid view in the "building blocks" tab of a workspace and the
"overview" tab of a tenant.

### Add API Key permissions for meshPaymentMethods
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We added fine-grained API Key permissions for managing Payment Methods via the meshObject API. You can now grant
API Keys explicit rights to list Payment Methods in a specific workspace or all workspaces.

#### How to use
When creating or editing an API Key in meshPanel, you will see new permission options for Payment Methods. Grant
the required rights to allow API Keys to access or manage Payment Methods in your workspace. For more details,
refer to the meshObject API documentation.

### Renamed Access Tabs for Improved Clarity
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we have updated access-related tab names to enhance clarity:
In the Workspace Manager, "Workspace Access" is now "Access Management"
Its child tab "Current Access" is now "Role Mapping".
In the project management area, "Project Access" is now also "Access Management" and its child tab 
"Current Access" is now "Role Mapping". 
These changes aim to make permissions and role management more intuitive for users.

### Better Error Message For Block Runs With Missing Outputs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The wording of the error message which is shown if a block run was marked as 
failed because outputs were missing or their types did not match the one 
specified in the definition was improved.

### Empty Building Block Selection on Azure Landing Zone
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you create landing zone of platform type "Azure", you will face an empty building block definition selection. This has been fixed.

### Keyboard Accessible Card Toggles
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Expandable cards on the building blocks detail page are now accessible via keyboard. 
The downward-facing caret icons are focusable and operable buttons.

### Fix Step Title of Building Block Run
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixed an issue where the first step in every building block run was always labeled 
"Trigger GitHub Workflow." Step titles now reflect the correct action.

### README now correctly persisted
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, the README value for the general information of a building block definition was not
persisted in case a building block definition was created or updated via the panel. 
This is now fixed and works as intended.

### Fixed Broken Link in Project Access View
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If you can not find a meshUser/Group within project access control then you get the information that must be assigned first to the workspace. 
This link was broken and now it is fixed.

### Fixed Building Block Default Input Number
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have fixed the problem with building block inputs from type number. The problem was that in case of a default value, the input was not being set correctly.

### Fixed Saving Landing Zone
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue that prevented users from saving landing zones. The problem was when
the landing zone was referenced by a deleted user the response could not be determined.

### Unmanaged Tenants tab title
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The title of the Unmanaged Tenants tab in the browser was not correctly set to "Unmanaged Tenants" when the user is on the Unmanaged Tenants page.
This is now fixed.

### Fixed Blank Page on General Tab Switch
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Resolved an issue where switching back to the "General" tab in the 
Communication Center after visiting another tab (e.g. "Receiving Workspaces" or 
"Deletion") resulted in a blank screen. Users can now navigate between 
tabs without losing the loaded content.

### Better Building Block Environment Variable Description
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The description texts for building block definition input variables have been improved.
Now it is clearer how those variables are handed over to the building blocks.
