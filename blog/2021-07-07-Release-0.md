## Ticket Details
### Fixed some tags not being able to be mandatory
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
It was not possible to set some older landing zone and payment method tags to "mandatory". This is now fixed.

### Single-select tag fields can be cleared
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Values in tag fields that have the type "Single-Select" can now be cleared out. This means users can set an empty value to the field. (This does not apply to mandatory tags)

### Landing Zone name in Tenant detail view
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
Besides being able to see the landing zone name in the list of tenants, the detailed view of a single tenant
now also contains this piece of information.
