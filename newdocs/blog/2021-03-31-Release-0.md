## Ticket Details
### Assign meshCustomerUserGroups to meshProjects
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
It is now possible to assign meshCustomerUserGroups to meshProjects
via the meshObject API. meshProjectGroupBindings can be imported which
specify the meshProject and the meshCustomerUserGroup as well as the
role that should be used for the assignment.

### Replicate member removal from group to meshIdB
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
After a member is removed from a meshCustomerUserGroup all relations between the user and the customer will now be updated in meshIdB. That fixes some edge-cases where access to OpenStack and AWS was still possible after removing a member from a group.
