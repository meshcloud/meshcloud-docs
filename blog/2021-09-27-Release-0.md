## Ticket Details
### Disable Customer Owner required in Customer Access Control
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
We will still enforce to have Customer Owners assigned during the creation of a meshCustomer in the meshPanel. In some cases it is necessary to manage access control within the account area without at least one Customer Owner assignment. We will temporarily disable the enforcement of the Customer Owner after the creation of a meshCustomer which will only have effect on exiting meshCustomers with no Customer Owner. We will get back to you with more information how we handle this in the future and make it work for you.

### Projects overview redesign
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
This is the first step to integrate our new UI design. We have designed the initial projects view to support a cleaner and lightweight UI/UX. In the future, we will integrate all other customer-related functionalities step by step into a single spot to make it more user-friendly. Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in this new view in the coming weeks.
