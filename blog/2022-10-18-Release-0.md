## Ticket Details
### Prevent duplicate meshTenant import
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
When a meshTenant is in pending deletion, you were able to import a second meshTenant of the same platform instance. This is now fixed.

### Fix missing quota section in Tenant Details
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, when you access the tenant details of a tenant with an existing quota request, the approval section of the requested quota was missing. This is now fixed.

### Fixed access expired error for unassigned projects
**Audience:** User


#### Description
The Platform Access tab on tenant level was shown for customer admins and owners, eventhough they were not assigned to the project. This lead to an "access expired" error message. As the tab must not be shown at all in that case, the issue is solved now by not showing the Platform Access tab anymore for those users.

### Solved unassigned project not showing in project overview
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We've solved the issue that sometimes unassigned projects are not included in the project overview.

### Fix meshMarketplace access error message
**Audience:** User


#### Description
With the latest release we introduced a bug that lead to a "could not acquire access token" error message
when accessing a meshMarketplace. This error was shown in the notification center at the top right. All screens
were still working without any issues. This error message did not have any effect on functionality. The underlying
issue has been fixed and the error message won't be shown anymore.

#### How to use
When a meshMarketplace meshTenant is accessed the first time after the new release has been deployed, you may once see
an info message in the notification center, that replication is pending for this meshTenant. This does not affect any
functionality and won't be shown anymore when accessing the same meshMarketplace tenant again later on.

### Fix replication for pending deletion tenants
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
A bug prevented the proper replication for meshTenants that were in a 
pending deletion state and awaited manual confirmation. This has been fixed.

### Cloud tenant configuration page in project creation wizard
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We've separated the landing zone selection from the cloud platforms page during the project creation. The selected cloud platforms can now be configured step by step. If you select a cloud platform then a sub page will be automatically created for the configuration. Additional configuration options will be added to the new sub pages soon.
