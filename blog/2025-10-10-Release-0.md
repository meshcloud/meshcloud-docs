## Ticket Details
### User Invitation Tokens
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We added a new option for adding users to meshStack.
Within the management settings in admin area you can
now enable 'User Invitation Token' as an alternative to
'SCIM User Management ' or 'Manual User Invites'.
With this method users will receive an invitation link, 
that they can use to join their workspace, but only if 
they can already authenticate, e.g. because they have 
an existing account within an integrated IDP such as GitHub.

#### How to use
To enable the new option navigate to the management settings
in the admin area and select the respective option. 
To send out invitation links, visit the access management tab
within the workspace control plane or the admin access page,
then search for a new user and follow the 'Invite new user'
link.

### Single-screen communication creation experience
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Replaces the former 4-step wizard with one focused modal for faster, clearer
communication creation process. Delivers a live receiving workspace count,
inline filter panel, and side by side Markdown preview while
automatically pre filtering when launched from a workspace list.

### Add Tag Filtering to Payment Method List
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
You can now filter payment methods by tags in the payment method list. This enhancement allows you to quickly find and manage payment methods associated with specific tags, improving your workflow and organization.

### Add Tag Filtering to Project List
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now filter projects by tags in the project list under Organization > Projects. This enhancement allows you to quickly find and manage projects associated with specific tags, improving your workflow and organization.

### meshPlatform API v2 Preview Changes meshProjectRoles JSON Structure
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've improved the consistency of the meshPlatform meshObject API v2 preview version by changing how meshProjectRoles
are referenced in the JSON payload. This change aligns the meshProjectRoles structure with other API endpoints to
provide a more uniform developer experience.

#### How to use
If you are using the meshPlatform meshObject API v2 preview version, you'll need to update your integration to use
the new meshProjectRoles JSON structure. The change affects how role mappings are represented in API requests and
responses. Please refer to the updated API documentation for the new format and update your code accordingly.
