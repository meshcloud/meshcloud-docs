## Ticket Details
### Building Block Search Bar Remains Visible When no Results Are Found
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed a bug where the search bar in a lot of tables would disappear when no search results were found.
The search bar now remains visible, allowing you to refine your search without having to reload the page.

### Mandatory Building Blocks via API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Tenants can now be created via the API with mandatory building blocks that have user inputs with default values.
Previously, mandatory building blocks with "User Input" assignment type would prevent tenant creation,
even when default values were defined. This enhancement allows for more flexible building block configurations
while ensuring tenants can be created automatically via the API.

### Creator Can Now Be Removed During Project Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating a project, the creator was automatically added and could not be removed. This restriction has been
lifted. You can now remove the creator during the creation process, allowing you to create projects with a
different set of users or even without any users assigned initially.

### Building Block API Query Parameters Now Use Exact Match
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshBuildingBlock API endpoint now performs exact matching for all provided query parameters when filtering
building blocks. Previously, these parameters used partial matching, returning all building blocks whose field values
included the query parameter values as substrings. This could return unintended results when one value was a substring
of another. With the new exact match behavior, only building blocks with exact matches for all provided query
parameters are returned. For example, you can now reliably fetch all building blocks from one particular workspace by
specifying the exact workspaceIdentifier.

### Fixed Greyed Out Code Editor in Building Block Input Definition
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when creating a new building block definition and adding an input of type 'Code', the code
editor was sometimes greyed out, making it impossible to specify a default value. This issue has been
resolved.

### Search Filter for Workspace and Project Access Control v2 Tables
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A search filter is now available in workspace and project access control tables, allowing you to quickly find specific
users or groups by typing their name. This makes it easier to manage access in workspaces and projects with many users.

Note: This change only affects customers who have access to the new access control v2 feature. If you are using the 
standard access control interface, this change does not apply to you.
