## Ticket Details
### Fix Import Issues for Building Block Definitions From meshHub
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixed several issues when importing building block definitions from meshHub. The system now properly validates and
converts input types (boolean, integer, select options) instead of silently ignoring invalid data. Boolean default
values are now correctly displayed in the panel.

#### How to use
When importing building block definitions from meshHub, the system will now provide clear error messages if the
imported data contains invalid type conversions (e.g., non-boolean values for boolean inputs).
If you already imported a building block definition and observed problems when trying to create building blocks
from it, you can try the following: create a new draft from your building block definition, edit and save the
problematic inputs and then release the new version. This will fix the incorrect default values.

### Warning for Problematic Markdown in Building Block Input Description
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We added a warning that appears when you enter potentially problematic characters in building block definition
input descriptions. The warning helps prevent markdown rendering issues by alerting you when characters like '<' or '>'
are used without proper escaping.

### Improved Documentation for meshWorkspace Tags API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the documentation for the meshWorkspace API to clarify tag handling. The documentation now explicitly states
that you must always provide a tag object with all the tags you want to have on the workspace (you can fetch previously
existing tags for example via the GET endpoint). It can be an empty object, if you want to remove all tags or don't use any 
workspace tags anyways.
Additionally, we clarified which fields are read-only after creation.

### Quickly view a Project's Tenants in the Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have added a new action on the admin area project list to quickly view tenants
of this project. The link opens up the tenant list pre-filtered on the
selected project.
