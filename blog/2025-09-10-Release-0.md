## Ticket Details
### Accept building block STRING output as CODE type
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building block output that is of type STRING will no longer result in
a validation error when being assigned to an expected output of type CODE.
This means types CODE and STRING can be used interchangeable with respect
to building block output.

### Updated API Documentation for meshPaymentMethod Expiration Date Format
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The API documentation for meshPaymentMethod now clearly specifies that the expirationDate field uses the 
yyyy-MM-dd format and is considered as UTC, providing better clarity for API consumers.

### Workspace Overview Now Available for Workspace Member
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Workspace members can now access the workspace overview page to see assigned projects and resources within their 
workspace. Previously, this overview was only available to workspace managers.

### New Properties Added to meshResourceUsageReport
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshResourceUsageReport API endpoint now provides two new properties
within the line items, the sellerId and sellerProductGroup. Please refer to
the billing API documentation for more details.

### Prevent Creation of Duplicate Tenants
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, it was possible to create multiple tenants of the same platform within the same
project if the requests to create these tenants arrived in parallel. This issue occurred
in rare edge cases when tenants were created via the API or via Terraform. This has been fixed.

### Search in single/multi-select tags
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now search for values for single or multi-select tags by typing directly
in the dropdown.

### Building Blocks Auto-Run on Workspace Permission Changes
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building blocks that use workspace user permissions as input now automatically run when workspace user 
permissions change. This ensures your building blocks stay up-to-date with the latest workspace access 
configuration.

### Automatic GitHub Status Polling for GitHub Workflow Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
GitHub Workflow Building Blocks now support automatic status polling. Building Blocks can be 
configured to have meshStack automatically poll GitHub for workflow completion and job status updates, eliminating 
the need for external systems to manually provide status feedback via the meshStack API.

#### How to use
Enable this feature in the Building Block Definition's implementation settings by setting "Execution Mode" to 
"Synchronous". When configured, meshStack will trigger the GitHub workflow and automatically track its progress by 
polling GitHub's API for workflow and individual job statuses. This provides real-time status updates without 
requiring custom integration code. Use "Asynchronous" mode if you prefer to manage status updates manually via API.

### Display Validation Error Messages for Tag Regex Patterns
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When tag definitions use regex validation patterns, the UI now shows clear error messages explaining why values are 
invalid. Previously, users only saw visual styling (red borders) but no explanation of what needed to be fixed.

### Introducing Building Block Run Control
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We introduced a new Building Block Run Control option for building block definitions. When enabled, workspace users 
can see all logs and re-run building blocks. This gives app teams more visibility and control over their building 
block runs, improving troubleshooting and self-service.
Additionally workspaces that own the building block definition can now always see the system logs from the workspace
area, independent of the Building Block Run Control. That simplifies development of building block definitions, as
the logs can be seen directly when consuming them from the workspace area.

### Fix incorrect URL routing for German language
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixed an issue where URLs starting with 'de' were incorrectly routed to the German language version of the UI.
The routing now correctly matches only URLs that start with the '/de/' path.

### Remove Rate Limits on meshObject API in Production Environments
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The last meshStack release introduced API rate limits intended for evaluation in QA environments.
Due to a configuration bug these rate limits were also rolled out to productive meshStacks ahead of time and without proper calibration.

API consumers that were exceeding the rate limit have seen HTTP 429 responses in production environments. 
We fixed this now so rate limiting is only active in QA environments and will separately inform you about further rollout timelines and implications for production environments.

### Streamlined Expiring Access Warnings in Workspace Overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The prominent expiration banner has been removed from the workspace control plane to reduce visual noise. 
Expiring access information is now integrated into the workspace overview within the user cards, providing a 
cleaner interface while maintaining visibility of important expiration details.

### Improved Workspace Overview with Financial and Team Statistics
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The workspace overview now displays three informative cards showing last month's costs, team size with expiration alerts, and 
communication status instead of the previous generic actions needed card. These improvements provide workspace managers with 
immediate insights into their workspace's financial status, team composition, and pending communications.
