## Ticket Details
### Fix pending replications after tenant creation
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
In some cases, a newly created tenant stayed in a pending state until the nightly replication was running.
This also included the update of the platformTenantId on the tenant itself, if you e.g. requested it via API.
The tenant was still created quickly in the background and existed in the cloud platform. It was just not updated 
in meshStack directly. The update would only be applied with the next replication that was executed. This issue 
is fixed now and newly created tenants will go into a final state as soon as the tenant was created in the platform.

### Guidance for Adding Platform Services from Marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Users will now have clear guidance when adding Platform Services 
from the Marketplace with a progress sidebar that will accompany 
you through every step and show the current state. This will 
help to make the process smoother and ensure that even new users 
will not encounter any obstacles when using meshStack.
