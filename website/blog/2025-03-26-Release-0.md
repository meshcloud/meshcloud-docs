## Ticket Details
### Fix Azure and AKS platform config save problem
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that broke tenant replication based on a 
broken platform configuration on

### User With Controller Role Now See Financal Tab
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Users with the controller role could not see the "Financial" dashboard tab in the admin area.
This has been fixed.

### Add support for workspace level to meshBuildingBlocks API
**Audience:** Operator, User<br>

#### Description
We created a new version (v2-preview) for our meshBuildingBlock API which allows
you to manage both, workspace level building blocks and tenant level building blocks.
This is a preview version and subject to change until it leaves the preview phase.

### Fix Sorting of Communications
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the recently introduced Communication Center within the Admin Area,
sorting communications by their confirmation status or their resolution date
previously resulted in an error. This has been fixed.

### Fixed import validation for meshWorkspaceGroupBindings v2
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The declarative meshObject import did apply a less strict validation to
meshWorkspaceGroupBindings v2 objects compared to the imperative meshObject API endpoints.
This release of meshStack aligns this behavior. As a result, you may now see
meshWorkspaceGroupBindings v2 objects rejected from declarative import when an equivalent
role binding for a role-principal combination already exists.

### Updated LDAP Identity Connector meshObject API version
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The LDAP Identity Connector has been updated to use the latest version of 
meshObject API to keep it ahead announced deprecations. Please see the details of this release note for more details.

#### How to use
The LDAP Identity Connector now uses the following meshObjects:
- meshUser v2
- meshWorkspaceGroupBinding v2 
- meshWorkspaceUserGroup v1

### Exclude partner workspaces from communication creation
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Communications are now only created for non-partner workspaces when no specific workspace is targeted. This prevents unnecessary communication entries for partner workspaces.

### Payment Method Workspace Preselection
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We now pass the workspace information to the payment 
method creation page to pre-select the workspace. 
This is useful for affiliates who want to create a 
payment method for a specific workspace based on the 
workspace filter.

### User enabled/disabled event
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The event related to user was enabled/disabled was missing. Now 
we create an event for the specific action.

### Prevents Toggling Sensitivity for Building Block Inputs
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
This disables the toggling of the sensitivity level of building block inputs.
Toggling it was not supported and lead to an error upon saving.
