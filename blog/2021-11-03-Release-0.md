## Ticket Details
### Fix user identifier for SCIM API
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
There was an issue regarding a possibly missing id field in the SCIM API UserResource that has now been resolved.
Furthermore we improved the mechanism to match SCIM UserResources with existing users in meshStack to prevent
duplication of users.

### Unified AWS metering source
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this release, we have removed Cost & Usage Report based AWS metering from the product and have fully switched to
the more robust AWS Cost Explorer based metering. Cost explorer based metering results in lesser metering data collection and
generates usage reports that can be directly compared with the data shown in the Cost Explorer in the AWS Console.

### Fix declarative deletion of Customer Owner bindings
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>

#### Description
When using the declarative meshObject API by providing a meshObjectCollection during import,
it was not possible to remove a meshCustomerUserBinding of a Customer Owner via the API. This has been fixed.

### Replaced US date format with German date format
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The German date-time format (dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss) is now used everywhere except for chargeback statements and tenant
usage reports, which make use of the YYYY-MM-DD format and will continue to do so.
