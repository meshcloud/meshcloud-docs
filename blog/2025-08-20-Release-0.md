## Ticket Details
### Replace Terraform references with OpenTofu branding
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We updated all user-facing references from "Terraform" to "OpenTofu" throughout meshPanel to comply with Terraform 
branding guidelines and reduce user confusion.

#### How to use
All existing Terraform-based building blocks continue to work without any changes. The updated branding affects only 
the user interface text and icons - all APIs, code symbols, and technical functionality remain unchanged to ensure 
full backward compatibility.

### Fixed Substitute Payment Method Update in Admin Panel
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In this release, we resolved an issue where updating substitute payment methods via 
the Admin Panel had no effect. Changes are now applied with a UI refresh, ensuring 
updates are visible immediately after saving.

### Updated Azure AD References to Microsoft Entra ID
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
All user-facing references to "Azure AD" and "AAD" have been updated to use Microsoft's current branding "Microsoft Entra ID" 
throughout the meshPanel interface. This includes platform configuration pages, tenant dashboards, and building block descriptions. 
Technical variable names and IDs remain unchanged for compatibility.

#### How to use
No action required. You will see the updated terminology when configuring Azure platforms, viewing tenant information, 
or working with Azure-related building blocks. The functionality remains the same - only the display text has been updated 
to reflect Microsoft's current product naming.
