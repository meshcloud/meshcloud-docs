meshStack consists of 3 main areas for different roles inside your organization. 

- **The Admin Area:**  
  This area is used by the team who provides Internal Developer Portal capabilities internally to others. The admin area is the central place to set up, customize, and operate your very own Internal Developer Platform via meshStack. From here, we can get a high-level view of all of our resources and events. 

- **The Workspace Manager:**  
  Via the workspace manager, application teams can create and manage their environments. This includes adding and removing services, authorization, and financials for their environments.

- **The Platform Builder:**  
  The platform builder is THE PLACE for platform teams to offer platforms and services (building blocks) to application teams. For example, the Azure team in your organization could set up a workspace to offer their Azure Platform from there to the rest of the organization. Or the Networking team might want to offer their best-practice Cloud Network Building Blocks to Application Teams.

> **Note:** Enabling the Platform Builder in more than one workspace is only supported with the meshStack Platform Ecosystem module.
