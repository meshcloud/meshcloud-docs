## Ticket Details
### Tenant Overview display bug
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
Fixes a partially failed migration that could lead to the Tenant overview not getting displayed in 
certain environments.

### Fixes AKS usage with multiple groups
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
Fixes the bug that multiple configured AKS role mappings prevented users from accessing the
AKS namespace.
Also lifts the requirement to setup the Azure UPN as meshUser EUID.

### Project overview contains all projects for Customer Admins
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
As a Customer Admin, you can now see all projects of your customer in the new customer control plane. If you are not assigned to the project you will see an info message and the row will be greyed out.

### Improves messages for tenant seq. number errors
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
Error message now indicates the actual source of the problem instead of being generic.

### Customer deletion in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
As a Customer Owner, you can now delete your meshCustomer in the 'Danger Zone'. To delete the Customer, you have to navigate to Settings in the customer control plane and access the tab 'Danger Zone'. With this change, the whole 'General' section has moved to the new control plane. Navigating to Account by clicking on the cogwheel will lead you to the Projects page.

### Make all tenants available for private marketplaces
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
When developing new service brokers you can use your private marketplace for development. Only your meshCustomer
has access to it. You can now select all meshTenants of the project for a tenant service in such a
private marketplace. Before the change you were only able to select tenants from the same location the marketplace
belongs to.

### Expired Project Access in customer control plane
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
We have integrated the Expired Project Access page into the redesigned customer entry page.
Managing your Expired Project Access is no longer possible in the Account area. If you press the 'Expired Access' sidebar entry,
you will be automatically redirected to the new view.
Be aware that we will incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.

### See number of pending access requests in tab view
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
We have made it easier for Customer Admins to the see the number of pending access requests.
If you are in the customer control plane, the number badge of the 'Access Control' tab will now show
the number of pending access requests in blue (if you have any pending access requests). Customer Admins
can now quickly see if they are required to approve or decline any pending access requests.

### Project control plane integration
**Audience:** Customer, User


#### Description
We've integrated the project control plane with all related child screens. The project dashboard is no longer available. The tenants and financials screens are integrated into the project control plane. Be aware that we'll incrementally release more and more features in the new UI design in the coming weeks.
