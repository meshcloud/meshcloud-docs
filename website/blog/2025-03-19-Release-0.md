## Ticket Details
### New meshObject API endpoints for meshUsers
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API in meshStack now provides new endpoints for POST, PUT and DELETE operations on meshUsers. 
These endpoints require an API Key with the appropriate admin permission. 
We recommend using these endpoints only for advanced IAM integration scenarios where you cannot use meshStack's SCIM integration.

### Building Blocks on Workspace Control Plane
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We changed the content of the building blocks tab on the workspace control plane
so it shows only building blocks on workspace level and no longer any building blocks
that belong to tenants of the current workspace.

### Fix Placeholders in Building Block Failed E-Mail
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When an email was sent for a workspace building block, the tenant related fields were still shown in the email.
Those fields are now not shown anymore for workspace level building block.

### Fix Update of Unmanaged Tenants
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When importing an unmanaged tenant into meshStack, the tenant remained in the unmanaged tenant list.
This issue only affected meshStacks that were set up since December 2024. The issue is fixed now.

### Expandable Tags
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now have a button to expand/collapse the tags. This is useful when you have a lot of tags and you want to see them all at once.

### Fixed Workspace Filtering
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the admin area projects list, the workspace filter was not working correctly. This has been fixed.

### Fix Error on Communication Definition Deletion
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Release v2025.10.0 introduced a regression that led to an error when a communication definition was deleted.
This has been fixed.

### Building Block Runs fail on Missing Outputs
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously a building block run that did not return all the expected outputs would be successful
but children depending on the now missing outputs never ran and seemed stuck.
Now if a run ends but not all outputs are provided it is marked as failed so building block developer
can quickly identify this problem and fix it.

### Removal of old Azure Role management API
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We have updated the Azure API for role management to the latest version, now also in use for 
Azure Kubernetes platforms and Azure Blueprint assignment functionality. No behavior changes are expected.

### Inputs in Platform Configurations are Trimmed
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Form inputs in the admin area's platform configuration are now automatically 
trimmed for whitespace, reducing copy-and-paste errors.

### Unsaved Changes Alert in Building Blocks Definition
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To enhance building blocks definition creation and editing, and reduce unintended data loss, users will now receive a confirmation 
alert when navigating away from the building blocks definition creation or edit page with unsaved changes.

### Minor Changes to API Key Login
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This release introduces minor changes to the way meshStack records API Key logins.
When calling "/api/login" clients will now receive a HTTP 307 redirect code to meshStack's identity broker
instead of the HTTP 308 code used previously. This prevents client-side caching of the redirect URL.
meshStack now updates the "last login" timestamp for an API key upon login attempt instead of only updating the timestamp
on successful API requests. This change ensures that the "last login" timestamp accurately reflects attempts to use the API key.

### Rename Platform Type Marketplace to OSB Services
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
This ensures a consistent naming across the application.

### Abort Building Block Run Improvement
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The functionality to abort a ongoing building block run
has been improved in a way that all asynchronous runs are 
now aborted immediately within meshStack.
