## Ticket Details
### Fix deprecated Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, Building Block Definitions owned by a workspace with several published versions were incorrectly shown as deprecated. Now, they are accurately displayed as published.

### Landing zone-only definitions not shown in Marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building Block Definitions marked as 'Use in Landing Zones only' were erroneously accessible in the Marketplace via the "Related to" section of a Platform. This allowed users to select and book these definitions without the required landing zone, contrary to their intended use. This issue has been fixed.

### Lenient parsing of OpenStack catalogs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When configuring OpenStack, operators have a lot of freedom to configure catalog entries.
We fixed an error where meshStack failed to parse catalogs containing unexpected "interface"
values for a catalog entry.

### Improved Tags Layouts with Hover-Activated Overflow
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we've resolved container overflow issues caused by long tag values. Now, our application 
displays approximately three tag values visibly, with the remaining tags shown when hovered over. This 
enhancement ensures improved readability and user experience, addressing concerns about disrupted layouts 
and extended content beyond screen boundaries.

### Define Policies from Workspace to Landing Zone
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It is now also possible to define a Policy from Workspace to Landing Zone. A good example for 
such a policy is e.g. a policy for a matching Business Unit on your Workspaces and Landing Zones.
That way, you can restrict certain Landing Zones to only Workspaces that belong to a certain Business Unit.

### Better replication remarks for users without an EUID
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Users whose EUID is missing, can not be added to a platform tenant. But previously
the error replication remark was not consistent and on rare occasions could be missing. 
This has been fixed.

### Manage your API Keys from within your workspace
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
API Keys for their own workspace can now be managed by Workspace Owners and Workspace Managers.
Navigate to the 'API Keys' sub tab within the 'Workspace Access' tab on the Workspace Control Plane to do so.

### Manage projects with API Keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now use your API Keys to manage (create, update, delete) projects
within your workspace. More objects will be supported soon.
