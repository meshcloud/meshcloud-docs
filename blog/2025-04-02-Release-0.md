## Ticket Details
### No service configuration possible while creating a tenant
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that could prevent the configuration of any service during tenant creation
while a building block definition with a single version was pending approval for this platform.

### Fix selecting all for building block bulk operations
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
This fix addresses an issue where the "Select All" checkbox in the building block
bulk operations did not function correctly. It did not consider the context it was
in. So e.g. instead of only selecting all building blocks of the currently open building
block definition, it considered all building blocks the user has access to. This
is fixed now and only the intended building blocks are considered.

### Improves Behavior for Draft Landing Zone Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When you added unreleased building blocks as mandatory or recommended on a landing zone and are a user of a
owning workspace you can now create tenants with this landing zone via the panel without an error.
Regular users outside of the owning workspace can continue to create tenants in this landing zone
without the draft building block until it is in a released state.

### Show Only Open Communication Items
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The number on the badge now shows only the open communications.
This ensures users have a complete overview of important updates 
and information without needing to navigate elsewhere.

### Distinguish between Different Communication Types
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The workspace area has been updated to distinguish between "Action Required" and "Notification" items.

### Hides Non-Published Building Blocks in Marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the "related" tab of the marketplace view users outside of the provider workspace 
could see (but not use) unpublished building blocks. Now you only see those building blocks 
if you are a user in the owning workspace of the definition.

### Clearer error message when Terraform cannot be parsed
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When creating a Terraform building block definition, if the Terraform code cannot be parsed,
an unclear error message would pop up. We have improved this error message and made it more clear
that even though an error occurred, you can still continue the building block definition creation process.

### Improved Sorting for User Lookups
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the relevance sorting when adding users or groups to your workspace.
This should help to find the right user or group quicker.

### Improved filtering for meshBuildingBlocks API
**Audience:** Operator, User<br>

#### Description
We improved the filtering options for the meshBuildingBlock API v2-preview.
The endpoint remains in preview mode for now. Future changes might still occur.

### Sorting of Communications by sent date
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The communication list in the admin area now defaults to sorting by the "Send On" date, 
showing the most recent communications at the top. This change enhances usability by making 
recent items easier to find and reducing the need for manual sorting.

### Searchable Global Groups
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We added a search field to the global groups overview in admin area.
This allows you to search for global groups by name or identifier.

### Added missing columns to the chargeback statement export
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
To be compliant with the public API, we've added the two missing 
columns "baseCurrency" and "baseNetAmount" to the CSV export of 
the chargeback statement.
