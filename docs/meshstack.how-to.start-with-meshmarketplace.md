# Welcome to the meshMarketplace
The meshStack marketplace enables you to serve and manage your services in the meshPanel.

Offering your services in the central cloud foundation portal has the following benefits:
- easier reach customers which already are approaching cloud services
- out-of-the-box billing capabilities
- (optional) user assignment through the cloud foundation portal

We suggest you to setup your Service Broker using meshcloud open-source project "Unipipe-Service-Broker". The Unipipe-Service-Broker will enable you fast and quick demo setup, quick iterative service development and a quick time-to-market.
The Unipipe-Service-Broker will reduce your own code development efforts as it provides the basic functionality required by the Open Service Broker API reference.

# Requirements
Service Owner need to implement their service according to the Open Service Broker API (https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/).
The reference for the Open Service Broker API can be found here: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md

If you want to offer a service in the marketplace you need meet the following requirements:
- Your own meshCustomer in the meshPanel where you can add your Open Service Broker
- Your Open Service Broker implementation including a catalog definition
