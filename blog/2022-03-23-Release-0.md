## Ticket Details
### Customer roles no longer selectable for Partners
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
To prevent confusion on which role(s) to pick for your partner users, the Customer roles (Owner, Admin & Employee)
have been removed from the Partner Access Control page. This page will now only show Partner-related roles.

### No longer show outdated unmanaged tenants
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Unmanaged tenants are useful to get an overview of all the tenants not yet under your management in meshStack.
However, when deleting this tenant in the cloud platform, meshStack did not recognize the deletion and the
unmanaged tenant would stay around indefinitely. This is now fixed and after not observering the cloud tenant
for three days, the unmanaged tenant will be deleted.
