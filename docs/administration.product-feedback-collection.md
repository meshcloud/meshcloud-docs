## In-Product Satisfaction Survey

We may occasionally show a short survey in meshStack to gather your feedback.  
You'll see three quick questions about your experience.  
*If your organization uses a custom name for meshStack, you'll see that name in the survey.*

**When does the survey appear?**

- You’re not an Admin Area user.
- You’ve logged in more than three times in the last 30 days.
- You haven’t seen the survey in the last 30 days.
- You’ve been inactive for at least 25 seconds.

*Note: The survey is always enabled for each meshStack.*

## Product Usage Data

We use [plausible.io](https://plausible.io/data-policy) to collect anonymous usage data, helping us improve meshStack.  
This data is stored securely by meshcloud and never shared externally.

**What do we collect?**

- Satisfaction ratings (e.g., after creating a project)
- Usage metrics (how often and how you use features)

**How to enable usage data collection:**  
Your Customer Success representative can enable this after your confirmation.

```dhall
let Plausible =
    { activatePlausibleTracking : Bool }
let example = { activatePlausibleTracking = True } : Plausible
```
