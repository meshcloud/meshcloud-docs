## Ticket Details
### Building Block Outputs Now Display False and Zero Values
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building block outputs now correctly display falsy values like boolean false and number zero. Previously,
these values were hidden from the UI even though they were valid outputs from your building blocks.

### Azure Role Assignment Clean Up when Groups are Recreated
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixed an issue where Azure role assignments were not properly cleaned up when platform groups were deleted 
and recreated due to configuration changes. When Azure platform group naming rules change via platform configuration,
existing groups will be properly deleted including all their role assignments before new groups are created.

### Fix Validation for meshPlatform V1 Requests
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, in our meshPlatform v1 API, the request payload was not validated correctly such that requests were accepted when the meshPlatform was set to both 'PRIVATE' and 'PUBLISHED', even though the two options are mutually exclusive. This has been fixed, which means that such requests are now rejected.

### Introduce meshPlatform API v2-preview Version
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We introduced a new preview version (v2-preview) of the meshPlatform meshObject API. This version includes renamed 
fields compared to the v1 version to improve API consistency and provide a better developer experience when 
integrating with meshStack. The existing version v1 remains available.
Note that this is a preview version with the usual limitations that apply for preview 
versions. Please refer to our official API documentation for more details.

### Smooth Transition for AWS Account Status Changes
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
AWS announced changes to how account status information is provided in their Organizations API on 21.09.2025.
The transition to the the changes must be completed by 09.09.2026.
We've already updated meshStack to seamlessly handle these changes, ensuring continued reliable AWS account 
operations without any disruption to your workflows.

### Improved Input Encryption for Self-Hosted Building Block Runners
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have made internal improvements to enhance encryption capabilities for building blocks.
These changes lay the groundwork for upcoming support of self-hosted workload identity federated
building block runners, which will provide you with greater flexibility and security options for
your infrastructure automation workflows. While these improvements are not yet visible, they ensure
a smoother rollout of the enhanced building block runner capabilities in future releases.

### Workload Identity Federation Support for Terraform Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now support Workload Identity Federation (WIF) for Terraform building blocks using the
shared Terraform/OpenTofu runner hosted by meshcloud. This allows secure access to GCP, AWS, and Azure
resources without storing long-lived credentials. You can now generate WIF authentication inputs
and access all the configuration details required to set up WIF directly in the building block
definition implementation tab.

Note: This feature is currently available for the Terraform/OpenTofu runner hosted within your meshStack.
We are actively working on providing the ability to support self-hosted runners,
configure WIF and other authentication methods according to their own requirements.

### Building Block Run Details Show Definition Link
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building Block Run details page now includes a "Go to building block definition" button that links to 
the corresponding Building Block definition page.
