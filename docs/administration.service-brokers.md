To manage Open Service Brokers that are available in the system go to the Service Broker page of **Marketplace** section of the **Administration** area .

All available Service Brokers are listed here, even the [private](meshstack.OSBServicesPlatform.development#register-your-service-broker) ones. This provides admin users with an overview about all Service Brokers in the system.

## Approve Service Broker

When a user [publishes](meshstack.OSBServicesPlatform.development#publish-your-service-broker) a Service Broker, an admin user has to approve the Service Broker first. To approve a Service Broker, the **check** button for the according Service Broker must be clicked. After approval, the services of the approved Service Broker will be available for all users in the Marketplace Catalog.
