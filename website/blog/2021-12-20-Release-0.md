## Ticket Details
### Add new tenants directly in project control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to add a new tenant directly in the list of tenants in the project control plane. This makes it easier to manage your tenants in one place.

### Manage Quotas in the tenant control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
You can now create, update or delete quota requests for your tenants in the tenant control plane by navigating to Settings > Quotas.

### Fix redirect after project deletion
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
In rare cases it could have happened that you were redirected to the not-found screen after deleting a meshProject.
This has been fixed now.

### Introduces sequential tenant number as template placeholder
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously there was no attribute that was guarenteed to increase in sequence for every meshTenant. With the introduction
of this property it is now possible to use this inside string template configuration to access this sequential number in configuration
based strings or lambda functions.
For more information about the string template functions check the documentation under: 
https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.replication-configuration.html#string-templating

### Fix 'Add my groups' position in project creation modal
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
With the recent release we introduced a modal for the project creation worfklow.
This change made the position of the 'Add my groups' dropdown in the Project Access Control partially out of view.
This is now fixed and the dropdown is fully visible on the page again.

### Removal of meshTenants via Tenant Control Plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
OpenStack, Cloud Foundry and meshMarketplace tenants can now be removed from a meshProject via the
Settings / Danger-Zone tab in the Tenant Control Plane. The ability to remove these tenants has been removed
from the project edit screen in the Account Area. Support for removing tenants of other platforms
will follow in future.

### Tenant management for unassigned customer admins
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
Customer Admins are now enabled to view and manage tenants in the new control planes, even when not assigned to the project.
Therefore you will get an overview of all existing tenants within the project tenants screen but with less information because an unassigned user can not access the platform. If you do want to access the actual tenant in the cloud platform, make sure to assign yourself a project role.
