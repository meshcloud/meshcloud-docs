## Ticket Details
### Fix Building Block Upgrade Status Display for Already Up-to-Date Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building Blocks that are already on the latest version are now correctly displayed as "already up-to-date" with 
green checkmarks instead of being shown as "conflicts" with red X icons in the bulk upgrade summary dialog. This 
provides clearer visual feedback and reduces confusion for users managing Building Block upgrades.

### Extend meshObject API with meshLandingZones
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API was extended to support the creation, update, deletion and
retrieval of meshLandingZones via the meshObject API. This API endpoint is experimental and in preview mode.
Please refer to the API documentation for more details.

### Version Selection for Building Block Creation from Platform Builder
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating building blocks from the platform builder, the system now defaults to draft versions when available, 
ensuring you work with the latest development version. Additionally, you can now choose between draft and the latest 
released version using a dropdown selector in the creation dialog, providing the same flexibility already available 
in the marketplace configuration.

### Hide Landing Zone Only Building Blocks in Workspace Overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building blocks that are marked as "landing zone only" are now excluded from workspace resource overviews.
These building blocks are automation components that are part of the landing zone rollout process and users
do not need to see these implementation details in their workspace overview.

### Fix Building Block Upgrade with only Default Values
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented building block upgrades when new inputs with 
default values were introduced in a newer version. Previously, only manually 
modified inputs were sent during upgrade, causing failures when the server 
expected new inputs with their default values to be included in the request.

### Improved Building Block Timeout Detection and User Transparency
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where building blocks could be incorrectly marked as stuck when they were actively being 
retried by the system. Additionally, we now show warning messages when building block runs experience timeouts, 
providing better visibility into execution issues and retry behavior.

#### How to use
When viewing building block run details, you will now see warning messages if the execution experienced timeouts. 
These warnings explain whether the run was retried or failed due to a newer run being available, helping you 
understand the execution history and any performance issues that occurred during the run.

### New meshObject API Endpoints for meshProjectRole
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API in meshStack now provides new endpoints for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations on meshProjectRole.
These endpoints allow you to manage project roles via the API, including creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting project roles.

### Fixed Incorrect Project Count Display in Workspace Overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where the project count shown in the workspace overview was displaying an incorrect number.
The project count now accurately reflects the total number of projects you have access to in your workspace,
ensuring you always see the complete picture of your resources.

### Add Create Project Button in Workspace Overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now create new projects directly from the workspace overview screen. The Create Project button is 
conveniently placed in the projects section, making it easier to add new projects to your workspace without 
navigating to separate pages.

### Feature Previews for Admins
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Admins can now explore and track feature previews in meshStack. The new feature previews section in the 
administration area provides insights into beta features available for testing, including user adoption statistics. 
This allows platform teams to evaluate new functionality before it becomes generally available and understand how 
their users are engaging with preview features.

### License Information Moved to User Profile
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
License information and software bill of materials (SBOM) have been moved to the user profile for easier 
access. You can now find this information directly in your user profile instead of the previous location.
