## Ticket Details
### Fix rare issue when user accesses a tenant
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
An internal error could produce errors during attempted meshTenant access via the panel. 
The actual access to the tenant on the platform was not affected. This fixes a rare 
condition that could trigger if a user property like the email address changed.

### Updated notifications for missing Payment Methods
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The text for the notifications about missing Project Payment Method assignments was updated. 
We improved the headline and added a call-to-action with a demand to set a valid Payment Method.

### Cloud Universe Tab on the Dashboards Screen
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
We would like to improve the understanding and transparency within your meshStack. 
Therefore, we've added a beta "Cloud Universe" tab on the Dashboards screen to visualize 
the meshObjects and their relationships to each other. Please stay tuned, as we will extend 
this tab with more functionalities in the coming weeks!
