## Ticket Details
### Exclude configured Cloud Foundry organizations from metering
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With this feature, meshStack can be configured to not collect metering data from specific Cloud Foundry organizations.
If metering for a Cloud Foundry organization is disabled no usage reports will be generated for the spaces within those organizations.
There are Cloud Foundry organizations which are used only for the purpose of automated Cloud Fondry system tests.
One use case for this feature would be to exclude those organizations from metering.

### OpenStack VMs Public API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
A new public endpoint is available for retrieving all OpenStack VMs (both active and terminated ones).

### Limited payment expiration
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Limited payment method can now define an expiration date.

### Remove support for password-based OpenStack RC files
**Audience:** Operator, User<br>

#### Description
When used with an Enterprise IdP connected via LDAP, meshPanel could be configured to generate
password-based OpenStack RC files. This version of meshStack drops support for this option in
favor of always generating RC files using OIDC tokens.

#### How to use
Users that require using password-based RC files e.g. for service automation should use 
meshStack Service Users for OpenStack instead. This encourages better separation between
human and technical users.
