## Ticket Details
### Billing Info in Chargeback Statements
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** kraken


#### Description
Chargeback Statements now contain relevant billing information that was
set on the related project at the point in time when the statement was created. It can be
configured per meshcloud installation which data is relevant for the statement. The information
is retrieved from the payment method defined on the project and/or via project tags, if these
are configured for the installation.

### Enhanced OpenStack Server Metering Data
**Audience:** Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
meshStack Metering now collects deleted server data from OpenStack. This improves accuracy of metering data
for OpenStack clouds that do do not provide Ceilometer/Panko telemetry.

#### How to use
Operators should be aware that collecting deleted server state data for the first time may result in increased 
load on the metering subsystem, as OpenStack Nova clouds do typically not purge/expire deleted server information.
This can result in collection of data about all servers that were ever deployed on a particular OpenStack cloud.
