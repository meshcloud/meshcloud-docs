## Ticket Details
### Fix Tag Changes in Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, when changing the tags of a meshObject, such as a Workspace or
Project, an incorrect Event Log entry was generated in some circumstances.
If the meshObject contained multiple tags and only one of those tags was
changed, the Event Log incorrectly stated that all tags were changed, even
though only a single tag was modified. This is now fixed.

### Enables single tenant CA Subscription creations
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
When the source and target AAD configuration setting matches for
Customer Agreement Subscription enrollments for Azure platforms
the Subscription ownership acceptance is skipped. This enables to
keep Subscription in the account they are originally created.

### Fix Building Block Link to unaccessible Building Block
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
If you have access to a tenant from the Service Management Area, you can also see the Building Blocks of that tenant.
If you don't own the related Building Block Definition, you will now no longer have a link to the details of that Building
Block, because you are not allowed to access these details. They are only accessible for the Building Block Definition owner
and admins.

### Improve error message if OSB catalog cannot be parsed
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
If the catalog of an OSB Service Broker cannot be parsed by meshStack, we now provide a more detailed
error message, so the operator of the Service Broker can resolve the issue in the catalog.

### Fixed approve/deny links in approval notification
**Audience:** User


#### Description
Previously, when you received a notification for requested approval, you would run into an error upon clicking the "Approve" or "Deny" links. This problem is now solved.

### Improve performance and resilience of Service Instance list
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
The list of service instances for operators of Service Brokers loaded rather slowly. It even failed
with an error, if the communication to the Service Broker did not work because of e.g. some network issue
or the Service Broker being down. Both issues are solved now and the list loads quickly and reliably.

### Improve Building Block Definition input/output error
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We've enhanced the error message for inputs/outputs deletion that are still in use by building blocks. It now offers guidance on the affected inputs/outputs and their usage within the building blocks, so you can delete affected building blocks first before attempting to delete affected inputs/outputs.

### Feature toggle for API Keys
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We recently introduced API Keys as a new mechanism to
authorize with meshStacks API within a workspace scope.
We now added a configuration flag for your meshStack
that allows to disable or enable access to this 
functionality on the workspace level.
Disabling the functionality will prevent
application teams to create API keys in self-service.

### Table filters work with spaces
**Audience:** Customer, Partner


#### Description
Previously, for some tables in the panel such as the Tenants table, filtering
did not work correctly when spaces were entered. This is now fixed.

### Improve meshStack robustness against high load
**Audience:** User


#### Description
There was an incident where database connections were maxed out, causing an unstable meshStack
for a small period of time. We have increased the connections to support handling more concurrent queries.

### Fixed mails sent with outdated information
**Audience:** User


#### Description
In rare cases, our users received emails with outdated information. This has been fixed.

### Fix receiving Quota Request notifications when unsubscribed
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
This fixes a bug where users were not properly removed from quota request
notification subscriptions and continued to receive notifications. Those users
are now correctly unsubscribed and will no longer receive these type of notifications.
