## Ticket Details
### Improved AWS Account Enrollment with Landing Zone Detection
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack now automatically detects if an AWS account is already part of an AWS Landing Zone before attempting
Control Tower enrollment. Previously, enrollment could fail without clear indication when accounts were already
managed by an existing Landing Zone. The replication process now checks Landing Zone manifests to
determine if the account is already enrolled, providing clearer status information about why enrollment 
is skipped or fails.

### Improved Stability for Service Broker Catalog Refresh
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the stability of service broker catalog synchronization. In some cases, when service brokers provided
very detailed service plan configurations, the catalog refresh could fail. We have now increased the storage
capacity for service plan schemas, ensuring that even large and complex service broker catalogs can be processed
reliably without errors.

### Fix Missing EGID Field in MeshWorkspaceUserGroup API Response
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshWorkspaceUserGroup API now correctly includes the egid (external group ID) field in the response. Previously,
this field was missing from the API response.

#### How to use
When you fetch workspace user groups via the meshWorkspaceUserGroup API, the response now includes the egid field in
the spec section. This allows you to programmatically access the external group ID that is used for integrations with
external systems. No changes are required on your side - existing API calls will automatically return the complete
data.

### Fixed Pagination Issue When Fetching Projects via meshObject API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixed a bug where projects could appear more than once when fetching them page by page via the meshObject API.

### Lock Cloud Platform Web Console URL for OSB Service
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have disabled the ability to modify the Cloud Platform Web Console URL for OSB Service platforms.
These platforms use a fixed URL, which is set and managed by us.

### New meshLocation API for Location Management
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API now includes meshLocation endpoints for managing locations programmatically. 
Locations represent geographical or logical groupings of platform instances within meshStack.

All API keys can read meshLocations. Creating and updating meshLocations requires 
appropriate platform management permissions. Note that there are no dedicated permissions 
specifically for location management.

### Enforce Tag Validation for Additional meshObjects
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When the tag validation setting in Settings -> Compliance -> Tags is disabled, tags are now properly validated for the following entity types: meshBuildingBlockDefinitions, meshPaymentMethods, meshLandingZones and meshProjectRoles. Previously, these meshObjects were not verified correctly when this setting was disabled.

#### How to use
If this setting is disabled in your meshStack instance (Settings -> Compliance -> Tags), the mentioned meshObjects will now be validated properly. No action is required on your side unless you have API integrations that relied on the previous behavior where these meshObjects were not verified.

### Renamed Query Parameter in meshEventLog API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We renamed the query parameter from `type` to `eventType` in the meshEventLog API endpoint for consistency with the
response payload structure. If you are using the meshEventLog API, please update your API calls to use `eventType`
instead of `type` when filtering event logs by type.

### Fixed Error When Accepting User Invitations
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where accepting a user invitation could fail with a database error. This prevented invited users
from successfully activating their accounts and accessing their assigned workspaces.

#### How to use
Invited users can now accept their invitations without encountering errors. The invitation acceptance process works
smoothly, properly enabling the user account and setting up the associated workspace bindings.

### Event Logs for API Keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now create event logs for API Keys. When you create, modify, or delete an API Key, these changes
are now visible in the Event Logs section in the admin area. This provides you with better visibility and
auditability of API Key changes in your meshStack installation.

### Restricted Default Workspace Tags Now Correctly Applied During Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed a bug that prevented restricted default workspace tags from being correctly applied during workspace
creation. Previously, when creating a new workspace, tags defined as restricted with default values in the tag
schema were not automatically set on the workspace anymore. This meant that newly created workspaces were missing important
default tag values that should have been applied automatically. With this fix, all restricted default tags are now
properly applied when creating a workspace, ensuring consistent tagging from the start.
