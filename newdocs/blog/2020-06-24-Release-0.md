## Ticket Details
### Improved Azure Cost Collection Robustness
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
Collection of Tenant Usage Report data from Azure Cost Management API is now more robust
in face of intermittent Azure API failures.

#### How to use
The improved collection routine uses more fine-granular checkpoints to store data collection
progress. This enables collections to resume failed Azure API operations in smaller increments.

### Fix initial user assignment
**Audience:** User, Operator


#### Description
Fixes an issue where users invited to meshStack for the first time could not successfully onboard due to a missing
customer role assignment. This issue only affected meshStack implementations where the username provided by the configured
Enterprise IdP is not an email address.

### Fixes exception during empty cloud resource processing
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** kraken


#### Description
Fixes an exception which could show up in logs during cloud resource processing of an empty batch.

### Landing Zone based GCP role mapping
**Audience:** Partner
**Component:** gcp


#### Description
Inside a GCP Landing Zone meshRoles can now be mapped to one or more GCP roles. 
Please assign all existing meshRoles a GCP equivalent.
