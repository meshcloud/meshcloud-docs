## Ticket Details
### Security Hardening - Pin Panel Dependencies to Stable Versions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have proactively pinned all Angular panel dependencies to stable versions that are older than 4 months as a preventive
measure against the Shai Hulud 2.0 worm. Based on current information, the library versions we used previously were not
known to be affected by this vulnerability. Additionally, our backend already uses fixed dependency versions, and we have
secured our CI/CD pipelines following all recommended security measures to protect against this threat.

#### How to use
No action is required from you. meshStack was not affected by the Shai Hulud 2.0 vulnerability, and we have taken
comprehensive preventive measures across the entire platform to ensure continued security.

### Fixed Building Block Run API Documentation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where the "Update source for a building block run" endpoint was not appearing correctly in the API
documentation sidebar. The endpoint documentation is now properly displayed and easier to find in the navigation.

### Fix Workload Identity Federation Input Generation in Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixed an issue where the workload identity federation (WIF) input generation was broken during building block
definition creation. This affected building blocks using Terraform and other runners that require
WIF configuration.

### Enhanced Author Information in meshEventLog API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshEventLog API now provides more detailed information about the author of each event. This enhancement makes
it easier to understand who performed specific actions in your meshStack environment.

#### How to use
When retrieving event logs via the meshEventLog API, you will now receive additional author details for each event.
For a complete description of all available author fields and their meanings, please refer to the official meshStack
documentation.

### Improved User Experience When Creating Tenants With Landing Zones
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the user experience when creating tenants for platforms with landing zones that have mandatory building
blocks. Previously, it was possible to navigate to the access control screen before all mandatory building blocks
were fully loaded, which could result in incomplete tenant configurations. Now, the landing zone selection dropdown
displays a clear loading indicator while building blocks are being fetched, and navigation to the next step is
disabled until all necessary building block definitions are fully loaded. This ensures that you can only proceed
when all mandatory building blocks are properly configured and ready for your tenant.

### Improved Building Block Input Change Detection
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where changes to building block input properties were not properly detected when the input value
came from another building block's output (dependent inputs). Previously, if you changed properties like the
environment flag or sensitivity flag on such inputs, these would not be recognized as
changes and could lead to missing variables during building block execution.

### Add workspaceIdentifier Query Parameter for Event Logs API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshEventLog API now supports filtering by workspace identifier. A new `workspaceIdentifier` query parameter has
been added to the event logs list endpoint, allowing API consumers to filter event logs by the exact workspace
identifier. This is in addition to the existing `workspaceName` parameter which performs a partial match on the
workspace display name.

### Fixed AWS Landing Zone Detection for Control Tower Enrollment
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We resolved an issue where meshStack was unable to detect if an AWS account was already part of an AWS Landing Zone
during Control Tower enrollment. This caused enrollment attempts to fail without proper error handling when accounts
were already managed by an existing Landing Zone. The fix ensures that the replication process now correctly checks
Landing Zone manifests.

#### How to use
In order to successfully incorporate the AWS Landing Zone detection feature, please ensure
that your meshfed-service role for the AWS replication contains the two new permissions for reading
landing zone attributes as described in the documentation.

### meshUser API Now Exposes UUID
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshUser meshObject API now includes a unique identifier (UUID) in the metadata section. This UUID uniquely
identifies each user in meshStack. Additionally, you can now filter meshUsers by their UUID using the new `uuid`
query parameter.

### Remove Legacy Config-Based Message of the Day Configuration
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have removed the legacy deployment config-based message of the day (MOTD) system from meshPanel. This
simplifies the deployment configuration and reduces complexity.

#### How to use
You can continue using the built-in message of the day capabilities through the self-service features in
meshPanel. The removal of the config-based motd does not affect the functionality of displaying
messages to users - it only changes how these messages are configured by administrators.

### Event Logs for Policies
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now create event logs for policies. When you create, modify, or delete a policy, these changes
are now visible in the Event Logs section in the admin area. This provides you with better visibility and
auditability of policy changes in your meshStack installation.

### Event Log API Supports Title Exclusion for Efficient Filtering
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshEventLog API now supports a new excludeTitle query parameter that allows you to filter out event logs by
title. This is particularly useful when exporting event logs to SIEM systems or other monitoring tools where you
want to exclude high-volume event types like "Building Block Run Requested" to reduce noise and focus on relevant
events. You can specify the parameter multiple times to exclude multiple event titles in a single request.

### Improved Building Block Definition Form Order
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The form layout for creating and editing building block definitions has been reorganized to follow a more logical
sequence. Implementation details now appear before runner configuration, making the creation process more intuitive.
Additionally, an outdated beta notification for GitLab integrations has been removed.

### Improved Event Log Author Information in Admin Area
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The event logs in the Admin Area now display more detailed author information. The Author column clearly shows what
type of principal performed the action (API key, API user, or human user) and identifies the specific API
key/API user/human user that executed the action. This enhancement provides better transparency and traceability
for administrative actions in your meshStack installation.

#### How to use
Navigate to the Admin Area and open the event logs view. You will see the improved author information in the
Author column for all newly created event logs. Please note that event logs created before this change was
implemented will continue to show the previous author format without the detailed principal type information.

### New meshIntegration API for Integration Management
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A new meshIntegration API is now available for programmatic access to integrations. The API 
enables automated management of building block integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps), including 
creation, modification, and deletion of integration configurations. Users can manage integrations within 
their workspace scope.

### Improved Unmanaged Tenant Import Stability
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the reliability of importing unmanaged tenants to projects. The import process is now more stable 
providing you with a smoother experience when assigning unmanaged tenants to your projects.

### Event Logs for API Users
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now create event logs for API Users. When you create, modify, or delete an API User, these changes
are now visible in the Event Logs section in the admin area. This provides you with better visibility and
auditability of API User changes in your meshStack installation.
