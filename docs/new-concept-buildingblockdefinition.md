title: Building Block Definition
---

A building block definition is a reusable template or blueprint for automating resource provisioning. It defines the configuration, parameters, and supported platforms for a specific type of infrastructure or service that can be provisioned in a standardized way.

A building block is an instance created from a building block definition. Building blocks are used to automate the deployment of cloud resources or configurations, ensuring consistency and compliance across environments. Users can select and configure building blocks based on the definitions provided by administrators or platform engineers.
