## Ticket Details
### Fix static Building Block inputs
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Due to a bug that was recently introduced with meshStack v2023.27.0,
static Building Block inputs that had been created before, were broken.
This has been fixed with this release again.

### SCIM Bugfix for PATCH requests
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, meshStack has rejected SCIM PATCH requests that were sent after a
user's phone number was changed or added in Azure Entra ID. This issue has
been fixed.

### Notification for Workspace Roles Recertification
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
With this change, you'll receive a notification one week in advance before your Workspace Role expires,
ensuring you have ample time to take necessary actions.
