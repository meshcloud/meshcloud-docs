## Ticket Details
### Consumption Based meshTenant Fees
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
With this feature, additional fees can be charged on a meshTenant. These fees are based on the amount of total
resource consumption in the cloud platform by that tenant. The additional cost items need to be configured as a percentage
of the total cost consumed. This cost will show up as a seperate row in the tenant usage report.

### Fixes Cloud Foundry Service User not assigned to project
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner
**Component:** cf


#### Description
Fixes the previously introduced improved user reconciliation for Cloud Foundry project user. It failed 
to take into account the handling of Service Users, which were accidentally disassociated from the project.
