## Ticket Details
### No Budget Alerts on unassigned Payment Methods
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
We improved the notifications about Payment Methods that nearly reach or exceed the allotted budget.
There will no longer be notifications on Payment Methods that are not assigned to any meshProject anymore.

### Automatically add missing marketplace during project create
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
If services are selected for a platform during meshProject creation, those services might be coming
from specific Marketplaces (e.g. one that only exists in an Azure meshLocation). When selecting such
a service, the according marketplace will now be added automatically as a meshTenant to the meshProject.

### Enables collection of GCP Carbon Model v6
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, projects that contained data from GCP Carbon Model v6 could not
be collected. This is now fixed.

### Show tenant services after project creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Users can now view attached services after the project creation. We added a Services tab to the tenant control plane where users can see tenant services.

### Enabling meshcloud notifications through slack
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this feature, meshStack can now send the same notifications you get via email to your organization's slack account, for example, notifications 
you should be able to receive are e.g budget alerts, quota limits, new tenant creation, etc.

### Delete deprecated API endpoints
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
All endpoints under "Workflow APIs (deprecated)" as mentioned in the API docs are deleted. 
The same functionality is available under the meshObject API.

### Improves meshObject API description
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Adds missing HTTP statuses to the API description.
Improves error messages for rare exceptions during meshObject imports.

### Improved performance during metering service startup
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes a condition that could lead to degraded performance shortly
after metering service startup.

### Enable next button in project creation for optional services
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when you created a project and decided for a tenant and landing zone with only optional configurable services, the next button was disabled. This has been fixed.

### Missing groups in identity sync
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When syncing group members from LDAP some groups could be skipped when filtering for specific groups was configured.
