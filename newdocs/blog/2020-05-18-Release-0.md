## Ticket Details
### Fix marketplace AAD-replication with invitations disabled
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** replicator


#### Description
meshStack can be configured to replicate marketplace projects to an Azure Active Directory.
Optionally, missing users can be invited with B2B invitations. There was an issue with project replication when invitations where disabled that has now been fixed.

### Fixes deadlock in re-auth mechanism for Azure
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** azure


#### Description
This fixes a certain re-authentication flow in the used HTTP client library for Azure API calls could lead to a deadlock and
therefore stall the replication pipeline.

### Improved group member lookup for Azure
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** azure


#### Description
Groups with 20+ members where in some cases inefficiently handled.
This resulted in more API calls than necessary. Behaviour was reflected in Azure logs.

### Reapply filters and introduced sorting
**Audience:** Partner, Operator
**Component:** panel


#### Description
The Inventory Tenants view, Resource view and Customer view now support reapply of filters.
Furthermore the Inventory Tenants view is poviding sorting by customer, projects, platform, tenant status and location.

### Unmanaged tenants collection for AWS
**Audience:** Partner
**Component:** kraken


#### Description
The recently added unmanaged tenants view in the Administration area now also includes AWS tenants.

### Filtered GCP billing data collection
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
GCP billing data collection query now filters data on the partition date.
This results in the BigQuery paritioned table support being utilzed, which reduces the amount of data processed
by the query and reduces the cost of billing data collection.
Furthermore, the billing data collection can now be filtered by configuring meshStack with an
additional filter. This feature can be used if you want to collect billing data only from a given GCP organization or
folder.

### See unmanaged Azure tenants in Administration area
**Audience:** Partner
**Component:** panel


#### Description
The Administration area has a new view, showing unmanaged Azure tenants. By unmanaged we refere to any tenants that are not
known to the meshcloud platform. In the future, more cloud platforms will be supported for this functionality.
