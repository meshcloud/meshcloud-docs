Workspaces are organizational containers that group users, resources, and environments under a unified structure. Each workspace can represent one or more business applications and serves as the central hub for managing multiple related environments, referred to as projects.

Workspace creation can be configured in two ways:

- **Self-service**: Users can register workspaces directly through the meshPanel.
- **API-based**: The creation process can be externalized and integrated via an API.

Each workspace includes:

- **A Workspace Manager**: for overseeing user access and resource configurations.
- **A Platform Builder**: for managing and customizing the workspace's technical setup.
