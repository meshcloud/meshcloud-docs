## Ticket Details
### Fix Audit Logs resulting in "Not Found"
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
Previously, attempting to view audit logs under 'History' on the platform control plane resulted in a "Not Found" error page. This has been fixed.

### Project and Workspace Deletion from Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
With this update, you now have the convenience of effortlessly deleting Workspaces and Projects directly 
from the Admin Area, without the need for any additional assignments on the Workspace panel.

#### How to use
On the Workspaces Page of the Admin Panel press the trash icon to delete a dedicated Workspace. If there 
are still Projects associated with this Workspace, you will be prompted to navigate to the Projects page where 
you can see a full list of Projects related to this Workspace. Here, you can delete your Projects by also 
clicking the trash icon. Keep in mind that in the process of Project deletion Tenants, will be automatically 
removed as well. Service Instances and Building Blocks have to be deleted individually. As a final step, don??t 
forget to approve the deleted tenant on the Deleted Tenants page and then delete the Workspace.

### Fix a rare issue during Project creation
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner


#### Description
We found out about an unlikely case where Project creation would not work anymore
due to a fragile calculation of the TenantPlatformNumber, which can be used in 
tenant naming patterns. This is fixed now.

### Workspace Role Expiry Date Settings
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
With this change, you can now make expiration dates for Workspace roles mandatory through the settings pages to 
control. Namely, you can control the duration of access for Workspace by setting a maximum access period for 
dedicated roles. For example, with a 6-month limit for Workspace Owner, users can't be assigned to 
Workspace Owner Role for longer than 6 months. If you don't make a selection in Settings, the expiration 
functionality will remain optional for users, meaning they can choose to set an expiration date without any 
limitation or leave it unspecified.

#### How to use
Navigate to the Settings page, and within the Compliance tab, select a time frame for a particular role.

### Fixes Workspace re-creation via meshObject API
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the re-creation of a previously deleted Workspace under
the same name. It also fixes another bug that prevented the usage of the same egid property
(external group identifier, see API Docs) for a Workspace User Group.

### Workspace display name not updated via meshObject API
**Audience:** Operator, Partner


#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the Workspace display name not being updated via the meshObject API.

### Operator inputs on building block control plane
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
You can now set and update inputs as an operator in the building block control plane of the admin area. Executing a new run of a Building Block has also been moved to the building block control plane.

#### How to use
Navigate to Settings > Inputs on the building block control plane. Put your new inputs into the form and press 'Save & Run'. If you want to start a completely new run without changing any inputs, just click on 'Start new Run' in the building block control plane's run tab. It will use the settings you have in the 'Inputs' tab to execute the run.

### Load Building Block inputs from Terraform variables
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
When creating or editing a Building Block definition, you can now automatically generate Building Block inputs by pasting in the Terraform variables code.

### Building Block notification links to new pages
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
Notifications for Building Blocks with required actions (failed, operator input) now link to the new table of
Building Blocks in the Building Block Control Plane in the Admin Area.

### Fix Permanently hidden Onboarding Guide Overlay
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner


#### Description
We recently introduced an overlay, that aims to guide
users through their onboarding when they create a new
workspace. Due to a recent change, the overlay was unintentionally permanently
hidden. This is now fixed and the overlay now will only be hidden when a user clicks
on the 'Hide Permanently' option.

### Fix for AWS replication regarding group deletion
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
We found an issue within the AWS replication that occurred
while deleting an AWS tenant. This resulted in tenants being 
stuck in the deletion process forever. The issue has been 
removed, so AWS tenant deletion works as expected again.
