---

This a guide that accompanies you on your very first stepts setting up a Internal Developer Platform with meshStack.

> **Prerequisites:**
> 1. Your new meshStack was setup and the link to the meshPanel was provided to you.
> 2. You need to be able to log into your meshStack to follow this guide.

## Step 1: Access the Admin Area of Your meshStack

The Admin Area is the central place to setup, customize and operate your very own Internal Developer Platform via meshStack.
To return to this view at a later point in time, you can always press the "Admin Area" button in the top bar.

## Step 2: Create Your First Workspace

Workspaces provide you the opportunity to onboard and structure your use cases. Those workspaces can act as consumers and providers of services within the marketplace. The marketplace is 
the central place in meshStack to offer services that others consume. 

Now lets get started by creating the first workspace in your meshStack. To open the wizard, click on "Create Workspace +" as shown in the picture below.

Of course, this can also be achieved via API. Take a look at our [workspace API](/api/index.html#_meshworkspace) to learn more.

## Step 2: Create your First Service 

The most central aspect of a Internal Developer Platform is offering services to other teams in your organization to jump start their projects, secure their application or extent their environments with additional ressources.
In order to create, test and publish your first service in form of a workspace level building block please follow this guide.

In order to start the step by step guide for you first building block access the workspace and click on Service Management or Platform Builder on the top right corner.
