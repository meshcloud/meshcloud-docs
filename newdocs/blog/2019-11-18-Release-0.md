## Ticket Details
### Poll AWS AVM completion status
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** aws


#### Description
meshStack can be configured to use an AVM for AWS account provisioning. In order to reliably determine when an
AWS AVM completed account provisioning, meshStack now polls for the tags "ProductName" and "State" on the provisioned
AWS account. The AVM has to set these tags when account provisioning is completed.

### Enhanced Kubernetes and OpenShift Metering
**Audience:** Customer, Operator
**Component:** kraken


#### Description
Kubernetes and OpenShift metering now also support metering on CPU limit level.
Additionally further improvements have been made to Kubernetes and OpenShift metering.

### AWS Account Alias can be customized
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** aws


#### Description
An Operator can configure the AWS account alias in the AWS replicator platform configuration.

### Bugfix preventing template instantiation
**Audience:** User


#### Description
A bug prevented the correct instantiation of templates when assigned by a OpenShift Landing Zone.

### Improves Project Deletion/Resource Check Notifications
**Audience:** User


#### Description
Improves notifications in order to make clear that currently deprovisioning is only available for Cloud Foundry, OpenStack and Marketplace projects.
We are currently improving the deprovisioning experience for the other platforms and support for it is coming soon.

### Loads all Landing Zones during project creation
**Audience:** User
**Component:** panel


#### Description
Fixes a bug which prevented the loading of all existing Landing Zones during project creation.

### Fix CF Routes in Resource Existence Check
**Audience:** User
**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Projects with Cloud Foundry platforms listed all Routes available in CF and not only the ones related to the tenant. This has been fixed, so only routes related to the tenant are listed. This fix also allows the deletion of projects with a Cloud Foundry platform again.

### Fix customer creation for unassigned users
**Audience:** User
**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Users without any assigned customer were not able to create a new customer. This has been fixed.
