## Ticket Details
### AKS multi role assignment
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A bug in the role assignment prevented the proper assigning of RoleBindings in the AKS cluster
if more than one meshRole was assigned to the same ClusterRole via the Landing Zone.

### Manage payment methods in project control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to manage your active & substitute payment method in the new project control plane that was recently introduced.
Keep in mind that more functionality will be moved to the new project control plane in future releases.

### Fix payment methods redirect in project creation flow
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
In the project creation flow there are two redirects to the list of payment methods.
These redirects were pointing to a non-existing URL. This is now fixed and the redirect brings
you to the correct page in the meshPanel.

### Fixes legacy Azure Subscription duplications
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes a regression that was introduced with v7.92.0 and broke the fallback mechanism to
protect against multiple Subscription creations during an error condition. Only the legacy Azure
Subscription creation was affected.
Note: The last release fixed the initial cause of Azure communication error during the Subscription
creation step leading to an error condition.

### Manage project tags in project control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
It is now possible to manage your project tags in the new project control plane that was recently introduced.
Keep in mind that more functionality will be moved to the new project control plane in future releases.

### Redesigned tenant overview in project control plane
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The tenant overview in the project control plane got a slight redesign.
The overview is now more compact and shows additional information such as
the platform tenant identifier.

### Improved handling of new meshPlatform Quota Definitions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, if you added a new Quota Definition to a meshPlatform, it would show up with a default
value of zero in the corresponding meshLandingZones, but the quota was not applied to the tenants. With this release, we have
made some changes to make it clearer to you whether the quotas have been set or not. Now, if you add a new
quota definition to a meshPlatform and view a corresponding meshLandingZone in the meshPanel, you will clearly see that the
default value for the newly added quota definition is empty and that you have to add a default value there. When you
set this value on the meshLandingZone, all tenants with that meshLandingZone assigned will get assigned this quota
during the next replication of the tenant.
Additionally, if a tenant or a tenant quota request doesn't have a value set for a newly added quota definition,
an empty field will be shown in the panel, instead of a zero.

### Improve navigation error message
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
If you encounter a navigation error in meshPanel, you only saw [object: Object] as an error message before. A new readable error message has been introduced for this.

### Access unassigned projects in 'Overview'-Tab
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
As a Customer Admin, you can now access the project access control plane of all projects via a click on the name in the project's overview. This also includes projects you're not assigned to.
