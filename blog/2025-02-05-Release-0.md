## Ticket Details
### Fix Location dropdown shrinking when searching
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When creating a new platform, you can pick an existing location from a dropdown. When you started searching
in that dropdown, the width of the dropdown shrunk, so locations became pretty unreadable. This is now fixed.

### Fix Access to Usage Reports in Service Management Area
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
In some cases, users were unable to access usage reports in the service management area.
This issue has been resolved.

### Fix error when adding new Building Block Definition Input
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Recently a regression was introduced, that led to showing an error message, when adding a new input
to an existing Building Block Definition. This is fixed now and no error message is shown anymore.

### Fix Access Information for Azure Kubernetes Service
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When accessing an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) tenant via the UI, the access information was not shown. 
Instead, an error message was displayed. This is fixed now.

### Fix Boolean Inputs in Building Block Upgrade
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When upgrading a building block, boolean values that were set on the building block were not shown in the upgrade dialog.
Additionally boolean values were not set correctly during the upgrade and therefore not shown correctly
when going to the settings of the building block afterward. This is fixed now.

### Fix Building Block Input Edit as Operator
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
With the last release a regression was introduced, that did not show the set Building Block values anymore when
editing a Building Block as a Operator. This is fixed now.

### Turning on and off Currency Conversion in Self-Service
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now enable or disable currency conversion in self-service. The
configuration can be found in the admin area under Settings, within the
Financials tab. Additionally, the user experience of this settings page has
been improved.

### Fix broken building blocks links
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Some links in the admin area & service management area leading to building blocks broke in the last release.
These have now been fixed and you should no longer run into any broken links.

### Fix "Open Repository" when no git reference is set
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Platform engineers can quickly open the terraform source code implementing a building block
from the Building Block Definition using the "Open Repository" button. This release fixes
an issue where that button ignored the "Git repository path" when the building block definition did not 
explicitly set a git reference (like HEAD or main). Now, the "Open Repository" button will correctly
open the repository in supported git providers (GitHub, GitLab, bitbucket) at the specified path.

### Improve Visibility of Payment Method Amount
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
When you created a new payment method, the payment method table only showed that 0 EUR are used. You did not see
the configured amount. The amount is now always shown, if set.

### Search in tables has been made more robust
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Search fields in tables now support special characters.

### Improvement of Workspace/Project Search in tables
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now search and select a dedicated workspace/project using a dropdown menu.
