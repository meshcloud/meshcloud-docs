## Ticket Details
### Building Block runners use external endpoints for callbacks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where Building Block runners were using internal endpoints, which caused problems when integrating with 
external systems that require callback URLs. This affected GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD pipelines, and asynchronous 
Terraform runs that needed to communicate back to meshStack.

### Fixed Adding Users During Workspace Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fix addresses the issue where users could not be added during workspace creation.
