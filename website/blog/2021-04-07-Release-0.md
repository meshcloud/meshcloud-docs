## Ticket Details
### Pending Quota Requests on Partner Dashboard
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
Partners and Platform Operators can now directly see on the Partner Dashboard whether pending quota requests exist.

### Username can be modified after creation with IdP property
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
When a user was newly invited/created its username can now be set after a property found in the AAD. The set username
can be modified by the rules of a printf string pattern. This is helpful in environments where the username should
be set to something different than the email address.

### Update Tenant Quota as Partner / Platform Operator
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
New Tenant Quotas cannot only be requested by meshCustomers, but also Partners and especially Platform Operators
can now update tenant quotas directly. They don't require a meshCustomer to create a quota request first anymore.
