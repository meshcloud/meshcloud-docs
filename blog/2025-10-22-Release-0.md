## Ticket Details
### Fixes Display Of Workspace Building Block Description On Small Screens
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed a display issue in the new experience screen where the description for workspace building blocks
appeared strangely formatted on small image sizes. The description now displays correctly, improving readability
and user experience.

### Email Preview for Communications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating a new communication, you can now preview how the communication will appear when sent as an email to
recipients. This preview includes all your appearance settings such as logos, colors, signatures, and footer text,
helping you ensure that communications look exactly as intended before sending them.

#### How to use
When creating a communication in the Communication Center, navigate to the new "Email Preview" tab to see how your
message will appear in email format. The preview automatically updates as you compose your message and uses the
appearance settings you have configured in meshStack. The preview is not available when selecting the
"skip email notifications" option for a communication.

### Building Block Definition Input Improvements Available in QA Environments
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have improved the building block definition input editing to reduce errors and make it more reliable. 
These improvements are currently available in QA environments for testing before broader rollout.

### Customizable 'Message of the Day' Colors
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now choose a color for the Message of the Day banner in the general settings. Select from neutral, primary,
success, warning, or danger colors to match the tone of your announcement. Additionally, we changed the behavior so the
legacy config-based message of the day is no longer displayed alongside the settings-based message of the day.

#### How to use
Navigate to Admin > Settings > General Settings. After entering your message of the day text, use the color dropdown
to select the appropriate color for your announcement. The preview will show you how the message will appear to users.

### Optionally skip Email Notifications for Communications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating a communication, you will see a new checkbox labeled "Skip email notifications to recipients".
This is useful when you want to create communications that are only visible in
the panel but without sending an additional email notification to the recipients.

### Fixes New SCIM User Login When Manual Invites Are Disabled
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed a regression in user authentication that prevented users from logging in. This issue occurred when a user
was created via SCIM and manual user invitations were disabled in the system. In this scenario, the user could not be
properly matched during login, resulting in authentication failures.

#### How to use
Users created via SCIM can now successfully log in to meshPanel even when manual user invitations are disabled in
your meshStack configuration. No action is required from your side, as this fix is automatically applied.
