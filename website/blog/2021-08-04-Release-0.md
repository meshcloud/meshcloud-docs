## Ticket Details
### Replication settings for tags have immediate effect
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Changing the replication settings on a tag in the administration area has immediate effect.
From that point on the next replication will add or remove the tag on the tenant in the cloud platforms.

### Altered description around behavior of quotas set to zero
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The description of quota behavior around zeros has been updated to reflect the accurate behavior of OpenShift.
Previously, the quota management user interface mentioned that a quota value of zero means the resource can be used unlimited.
This turned out to be not true for OpenShift and the description has been changed to reflect this behavior and make it more
clear to platform operators and end-users.
For the future, consult the platform documentation for the behavior of quota values as meshstack transfers these values 1-to-1.

### Flexible scopes for discounts
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
meshStack already had the ability to create discount line items in the tenant usage report. The discount could be
applied to all line items belonging to a specific seller.
With this release, we have improved this ability and extended the discount scope to support matching products and
usage types. Furthermore, we have added the ability to configure a regular expression for all three parameters(seller, product, usage type)
instead of an exact match, which makes the discounting feature even more flexible.

### AWS Reserved Instance & Savings Plan upfront fee line items
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In a previous release, we added the functionality in meshStack to add a discount line item
matching the amortized cost of the upfront fee of any AWS Reserved Instance or Savings Plan that was purchased
by a specific meshCustomer.
With this release, we have added the functionality to also show the initial upfront fee for the Savings Plan or the
Reserved Instance in the tenant usage report. This fee will show up in the month the Savings Plan or the Reserved
Instance starts.

### Missing user and system remarks during Tenant replication
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes rare cases in which user and system remarks of Replication Steps were not properly saved, and thus missing e.g. in the
meshTenant overview, after a failed replication.

### Maintenance screen for Platform Quota Definitions
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
A UI to manage quota definitons of each platform has been added.
Quotas can be added, edited or deleted.

### Improves Azure Subscription error handling
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Improves handling of Azure errors during Subscription creation.

### More resilient handling of unavailable meshStack components
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
In some cases a not available component (e.g. a database) had led to not being able to log in
to meshStack at all. This is now handled more tolerantly and meshStack only degrades certain functionality that
depends on the specific component.

### Add myself during customer creation
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
It's now possible to add yourself to the access control list during the customer creation via a button. This simplifies the self assignment.

### Assign multiple users during customer registration
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The customer registration access control wizard now supports the assignment of multiple users with different roles. It's necessary that at least one customer owner is assigned to register a new customer successfully.

### Trims Service Instance status description
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
More than 1024 chars in the status descriptions of a Service Instance lead to failure in updating/saving this
instance.
To prevent errors this field is now trimmed down to this maximum length.
