## Audience Personas

meshcloud offers different functionality to people with different roles. To make documentation clearer, we introduce different *audience personas* which helps to direct a feature or description to a defined target role. Authors of documentation or Release Notes should tailor their descriptions using these roles to communicate efficiently.

* A **User** is a person who uses the meshcloud panel to consume the meshcloud functionality, usually a developer or DevOps engineer. Users are focused on delivering value with their application deployments and use meshcloud to efficiently access, automate and administer the cloud technology they want to use. They want quick access to their deployment spaces and the resources they need. This means avoiding lenghty processes as much as possible, self-service and straight-through processing is key. Users usually work in teams which consists of colleagues of their own organizations or are mixed with external and internal specialists.
* A **Customer** is more a business-oriented role than a *user*. *Customers* have the responsibility for their users and projects in terms of data privacy, security, compliance, cost and capacity management (among others). Think of them as team leads or business managers/product owners with overall responsible for a business application.
* **Partners** have an administrator role. They are responsible for cloud management in the organization by providing meshStack to their internal *customers* / *users*. Partners can access customers' resources to support the deployment of resources or to perform other administrative tasks such as cost control, cloud compliance, permission management, etc (some of these roles might be taken by different people than Partners, however, we include them to the combined Partner role, as it represents an administrative role)..There is usually a contractual agreement between *partners* and *customers* that defines the obligations and rights of the *partner*.
* **Platform Operators** are also an administrative role but with specific technical backgrounds and responsibilities for operating and providing cloud technology to *users*, which include monitoring of cloud operations, integrating platforms, providing cloud services, and ensuring cloud compliance.
All documentation is split between the User Docs and Administrator Docs. User Docs are more oriented toward the basics of meshStack and could be valuable for all roles. Admistrator Docs are solely addressed to Partners and Platform Operators.
## Style Guide for meshcloud Documentation

### Language

* Primary documentation language is **English**.
* The tone is practical without personal opinions, viewpoints, rants etc. â€“ it's a sober technical documentation.
* Write short, but precise sentences. Make sure you give complete information and to reveal implicit conclusions or implications which might not be obvious to a fresh reader ("We can't read your mind, only your text").
* Do not bloat your texts by getting anecdotic, stating too many details or providing too many alternatives to reach a certain goal.
* Use paragraphs and sub headings in a meaningful way to structure your text for quick scanning.

### Formatting

The following formatting should be applied for contribution to the meshcloud documentation.

* Navigation Items: When you name navigation items such as **menu labels** put them in double-star **bold** (\*\*menu-label\*\*) .
* For `buttons` use backticks (\`button\`).
* No quotation marks around item names (") please.
* Use the style as recommended by [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint). For VSCode use the extensions `davidanson.vscode-markdownlint` to get inline linting.
* Whenever possible, prefer including code blocks with the help of the snippets tooling as explained in the [README](README#snippets).
