## Ticket Details
### meshCustomerUserGroup GET endpoint
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
meshCustomerUserGroups can be retrieved via the API. A list of all meshCustomerUserGroups as well as getting a single
meshCustomerUserGroup is supported.

#### How to use
The new API endpoints are described in the API Docs that is provided with a meshStack installation.
Click 'API Docs' at the bottom of the meshPanel to navigate there.

### Visual feedback during successful operations
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We have improved the visual feedback during creation and deletion operations. You'll get now a visual toast message at the bottom right if you create or delete a meshCustomer, meshProject, or meshTenant.
We are planning on adding more of these messages in the future.

### Fixed showing duplicate projects
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We've solved an issue regarding the project overview. Previously it could be the case that one assigned project occured two times. This is no longer the case.
