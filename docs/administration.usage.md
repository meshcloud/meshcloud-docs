Administrators and Partners have access to detailed usage reports of all their assigned meshWorkspaces and their meshProjects.
This enables administrators and partners to bill their meshWorkspaces per usage for all cloud platforms managed by meshStack.
Details about tenant usage reports and project statements can be found [here](meshcloud.project-metering.md).
