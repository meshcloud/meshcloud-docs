title: Platform Location
---

In meshStack, a **location** is a flexible label used to organize platforms. Locations help you group platforms based on criteria such as geographic datacenter, team, or organization responsible for managing them. This makes it easier to manage and find related platforms within your meshStack environment.

For example, you might use a location to represent:

- An internal IT department managing private cloud resources in a specific datacenter.
- An external service provider responsible for public cloud platforms.

The location concept is especially useful for grouping private cloud platforms that share a physical location, such as all platforms running in the same datacenter. For public cloud platforms, which are not tied to a specific physical location, we recommend naming the location after the provider or department responsible. This approach is helpful if you have multiple tenants or accounts for different stages and want to group them under a single provider-based location.
