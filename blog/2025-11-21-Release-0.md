## Ticket Details
### Fixed Error When Accepting User Invitations
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where accepting a user invitation could fail with a database error. This prevented invited users
from successfully activating their accounts and accessing their assigned workspaces.

#### How to use
Invited users can now accept their invitations without encountering errors. The invitation acceptance process works
smoothly, properly enabling the user account and setting up the associated workspace bindings.
