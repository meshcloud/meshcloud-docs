In the past we've used the term cloud foundation team to refer to the team responsible for managing the cloud infrastructure and services within an organization. This team is typically responsible for setting up and maintaining the cloud environment, ensuring security and compliance, and providing support to other teams using the cloud resources.

We now want to call that platform team instead of cloud foundation team. The term platform team is more commonly used in the industry and better reflects the team's role in providing a platform for other teams to build upon.

Refactor all occurrences of "cloud foundation team" to "platform team" in the documentation using the following steps.

1. Go through each markdown file in the /docs directory
2. search for the term "cloud foundation team" and suggest edits for that file
3. copy edit the text to ensure it flows well with the new term
