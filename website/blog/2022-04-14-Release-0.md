## Ticket Details
### Applying changes to previous tag settings
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously the tag catalogue in the "Administration Area" didn't show the currently applied configurations for some tags. Now the configuration is shown and changes can be applied to all or some of the values during edit.

### Platform Configuration for GCP via meshPanel
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
All configuration required for GCP replication and metering can now be done via meshPanel.
More platform types will follow soon.

#### How to use
Go to the Platform Control Plane of the meshPlatform you want to configure and navigate to "Settings" -> "Config".
Now you can enter all configuration options including the secrets needed for meshStack to access the platform.

### Platform Configuration for AWS via meshPanel
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
All configuration required for AWS replication and metering can now be done via meshPanel.
More platform types will follow soon.

#### How to use
Go to the Platform Control Plane of the meshPlatform you want to configure and navigate to "Settings" -> "Config".
Now you can enter all configuration options including the secrets needed for meshStack to access the platform.

### IdentityConnector cleans up groups
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When extracting user information from LDAP via the optional IdentityConnector
component, the generated meshObjects are put into collections. That enables
an automatic cleanup if the LDAP source does not list those relations anymore.

### Openshift support for self-service tags
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The platform integration of meshStack into Openshift now supports the modern tagging system that is similar
to the one for AWS, Azure & GCP. This means that administrators can now tick the 'Enable replication' checkbox
and all Openshift projects will be tagged on the next replication run.
We also improved the default tags of Openshift: all resources managed by meshStack are now tagged with `app.kubernets.io/managed-by: meshStack`,
`meshstack.yourcompany.com: $customerIdentifier` and `meshstack.yourcompany.com: $projectIdentifier`.

### Fix payment method identifier with slash breaking panel
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
For legacy payment methods that have a forward slash (/) in the identifier, the detail page of these payment methods could not be opened
in the meshPanel. This is now fixed and the details of the payment method can be seen again.

### Add Platform Identifier uniqueness check
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Added a check to make sure platform full identifiers are unique when creating a new meshPlatform.
This uniqueness check also considers deactivated meshPlatforms as they might be reactivated 
again.

### Prevent selection of global location for new meshPlatforms
**Audience:** Customer, Operator<br>

#### Description
It is no longer possible to select the global location as target when
creating new meshPlatforms via the meshPanel. The global location is
meant only for the global marketplace.

### Prefiltered meshProject tag values
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
meshProject tag values are now prefiltered if meshPolicies are active. This simplifies
the tag value selection by having invalid options disabled. Additionally, you can hover
over the shield next to the tag to see which meshSubjects are involved in the policies.
To get more insights, you can click on the shield to get to the list of existing policies.
