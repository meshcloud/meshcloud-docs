## Adding a Payment Method
Currently we support payments via Invoice or Credit Card. Before you can start to create projects you must add a payment method in the panel menu.

If you want to receive written invoices for your project payments please submit a request to us and we will enable this service for you.

## Removing Payment Methods
Before you can delete a payment method it must first be removed from all associated projects. Usually you add a new payment methods, change all project to this method and then the delete button is enabled to remove it.
