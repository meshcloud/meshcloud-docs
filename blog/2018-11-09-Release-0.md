## Ticket Details
### Make service instance status more transparent
**Audience:** All users **Component:** meshfed

#### Description
The status of service instances is now correctly called "Last Operation". It shows only the status of the last operation, not the current status of the service. Therefore the operation type (create, update, delete) is now displayed in the status badge as well. Details about the last operation are available as tooltips on the status badge.

### Add quota charts to project dashboard
**Audience:** All users **Component:** release

#### Description
Users have now an overview about all platform instance quotas.
