A **Landing Zone** is a predefined environment in which cloud resources are provisioned and managed. It provides a framework for organizing and controlling access to cloud resources, ensuring compliance with organizational policies and best practices.

Landing Zones are typically used to:

- Establish a secure and compliant cloud environment.
- Define network configurations, security controls, and access policies.
- Enable consistent resource provisioning and management across multiple projects and teams.

By using Landing Zones, organizations can streamline their cloud operations and improve governance, security, and cost management.
