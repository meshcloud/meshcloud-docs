## Ticket Details
### Explicit right to import tenants
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We added a new right to explicitly permit the import of existing
tenants into meshStack. This was previously possible for
workspace scoped API keys, but the new right is now only
available for API users. The new right needs to be added
to all existing API Users, that are used to import tenants 
via the new tenant POST endpoint. The declarative import is
not affected by this change!

### Fix Building Bocks with Operator input via API
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Building Blocks that have an operator input defined could not be created via the API. Creation led
to an error. This issue is fixed now and these Building Blocks can now be created successfully via API
and Terraform Provider.

### Improve tenant replication when removing a workspace user
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
If a workspace has many projects, removing multiple users from the workspace led to a long
queue of tenant replications within this workspace. This resulted in also other delayed tenant
replications. This issue has been fixed now and less tenant replications are triggered. This also
allows other replications to be executed much quicker.

### Enhance resilience of daily tenant replication
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
In rare cases an error when triggering tenant replication for all tenants once a day led to stopping
this daily replication. Therefore some tenants could have been excluded from the daily replication.
This is fixed now and all tenants will be replicated, even if some fail.

### Exclude expired roles from Building Block User Permissions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With the Assignment Type 'User Permissions' you can provide Building Blocks with the information on the project assigned user's including their respective project roles. Previously, expired roles were included in these permissions. This has been fixed.

### Tracking usage of API keys
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now see when an API key was last used to access resources in the new "Last Login" column. This should help you proactively manage your active API keys.

### Prevent User Deletion via UI when SCIM enabled
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, users could be deleted via the UI even when SCIM Management was enabled. This issue has been fixed to maintain SCIM as the authoritative source of truth when active.

### Fix Handling optional Single Select Fields
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, you encountered difficulty saving tags of a Building Block Definition when an optional single select field had no selected value. This has been fixed. Now, you can leave optional single select fields empty while editing your tags. Additionally, we have fixed an incorrect behavior where optional single select fields were erroneously indicated with a red bar, implying an issue when no selection was made. This misleading indicator has been corrected to accurately reflect the field's optional status.

### Remove Web Console Link on Building Block Deletion
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, if you specified an output with an Assignment Type 'Sign In URL' and deleted the associated building block, the link to the tenant would persist, resulting in a broken page. This issue has now been resolved; deleted building blocks will no longer leave behind links on the platform tenant dashboard.

### Fix API Key secret rotation
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that set the wrong secret when an API Key was rotated,
which led to essentially breaking the API Key.
Secret rotation now works correctly.

### Improvements on Replication Status Update
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fix drops duplicated replication requests instead of letting their
error override the legitimate status of the previous replication.
Duplicated replications can only happen under rare circumstances caused by internal
processes.

### Tenants from deleted platform now daily retried
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
A bug prevented tenants from deleted platforms to be included in the nightly 
replication.
A tenant is purged if the platform is deleted in which it existed. With this
fix such tenants are retried and can be successfully removed from meshStack.

### Policies between Projects and Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
You can now also define Policies between Projects and Building Block Definitions. These Policies will make
sure that you cannot create Building Blocks from that Definition in non-compliant projects. You will also
not see non-compliant Building Block Definitions anymore in the Marketplace within the Tenant Control Plane.
Additionally you cannot pick an non-compliant project when you choose a Building Block Definition
from the Marketplace on workspace level.

### Add Event Author in Notifications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, notifications only mentioned the author as "Admin" when informing meshStack users about changes such as role revocations, assignments to Workspaces/Projects, or role changes. With this update, users will now see the exact email address of the person responsible for the action in the notification, providing greater clarity and transparency.

### Fix for expired roles triggering excessive replications
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that could trigger a lot of unnecessary project replications
if a lot of expired roles were present. This reduces the load on the system during
nightly project replications.

### Support Dots in Payment Method Identifiers
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this fix, we now again support payment method identifiers with dots, enabling parameter modifications via API for 
these identifiers.
