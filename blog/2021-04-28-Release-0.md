## Ticket Details
### Configurable HTTP timeout for IdentityConnector
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
To account for slow transfers and/or big meshObject YML files the HTTP request timeout
for the IdentityConnector is now configurable and set to 300s per default.

### Error reference IDs for panel error messages
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
With this feature, we have introduced reference IDs to the errors that are shown in the panel. When you report
an issue to meshcloud, please mention this ID in the ticket, because it will help in investigating the issue.

### Simplified Local Id mappings of deleted projects
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In the "Deleted Projects" section in the Admin area, deleted projects can be expanded to see the actual Ids of their tenants in the platform.
This has been a list of rather technical mapping codes in the past. This is now simplified by just showing the localId of the
tenant in the platform as well as the customer local id if used in the platform (e.g. grouping projects by customer via OpenStack domains).
