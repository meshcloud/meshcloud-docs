## Ticket Details
### Fix panel not rendering with private platform instance
**Audience:** User


#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the panel from rendering if a meshProject exists
with a meshTenant of a private platform instance to which the current logged
in user has no access.

### Seamless rollover of budgets between periods
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
When Chargeback Statements are generated meshStack so far used the latest metadata like
payment information or project tags from the tenant. This has been changed now so for
chargeback statements the tenant data that was set at the end of the month of the chargeback statement period
will be used. This enables, if e.g. payment methods are rolled at the beginning of a new year
and chargeback statements for december are created a few days later, we are still using the payment info
that was set end of december before rolling the payment method.

### Extend list of proposed platform tag values
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
In the platform config tabs, "customerIdentifier" and "projectIdentifier" are now also available for 
selection when defining the mapping of attributes that shall be used for tenant tagging.
