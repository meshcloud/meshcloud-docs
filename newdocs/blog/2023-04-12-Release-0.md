## Ticket Details
### Upload a Building Block Symbol
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
You can now upload your own Building Block Symbol when creating a Building Block. This makes your Building Blocks easily distinguishable for your users at first sight.

### Show Details only for Tenant Building Blocks
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
We have recently introduced the Building Block Details screen. If you clicked on the 'Show Details' of a Tenant Service to go to this screen, an empty page was displayed. As the details screen is not yet available for those Tenant Services, but only for the new Building Blocks, the "Show Details" button is not shown for Tenant Services anymore.

### Improved meshPlatform config Audit Logs
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
With this change, you can now identify the exact change of 
meshPlatform configuration, where the red line points out 
the state before and the green after an applied change respectively. 
Please stay tuned since we will update the audit logs for meshPlatforms 
further!

### Platform Tenant Id as Building Block Input
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
"Platform Tenant Id" can now be selected as an Input Type for Building Blocks. With this, e.g. Terraform
Building Blocks can provision resources inside a platform tenant.

### Define Outputs for Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
Outputs can now be defined for Building Blocks. Only outputs defined on a Building Block will be shown
and can be used in meshStack.

### Building Block Deletion
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
Building Blocks can now be deleted from the Building Block Overview screen in the Admin Area.
When deleting a Building Block, it will also delete this Building Block from all meshTenants
it was added to. This does not include resource deletion in the cloud platform.

### Terraform Logs in Tenant Details View
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
You can now find the logs of the last terraform execution in the Tenant Details View under Building Blocks. Select a Building Block from the left side to view its logs.

### Terraform Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
The new Implementation Type 'Terraform' is now available for Building Blocks. Your Terraform module must be located in a public git repository and only a 'terraform apply' will be done when a new Building Block is added to a meshTenant. Further functionality like supporting private repositories, drift detection via 'terraform plan', resource deletion via 'terraform destroy' and more will follow.

### Filter information in dashboard graph
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
This update introduces a new filtering feature that allows you to easily customize your charts. Using the legend, 
you can filter the data in the chart by clicking on a specific item. For example, on the "Cost Over Time" chart 
located in the "Financials" tab, you can select a specific Azure platform from the legend to view costs that are 
exclusively related to that platform. This feature offers a quick and efficient way to analyze the data that matters
most to you.

### Improved User Management Performance via API
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
Previously, when you had a meshCustomer group with a lot of users (more than 100), API calls could 
often lead to failures when adding or deleting users from this group via meshObject API. 
The internal handling was improved and bigger groups are now supported.

### Improves deep link support in notifications
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
The notification system now has better support for deep linking into the meshPanel.
This allows the creation of links that directly take the reader of a notification message
to the right place in the panel. At the moment this is used only available for notifications 
targeting manual Building Block creation.

### Environment variables for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator


#### Description
We added the option to declare Building Block inputs
as environmental variables. This will change the way 
how those inputs are interpreted. This option has no
relevance for manual Building Blocks, but will be used
by the upcoming implementation for Building Blocks
backed by Terraform e.g. to define Terraform Provider
configuration.

### Building Block Deletion during meshTenant deletion
**Audience:** User, Customer


#### Description
When deleting a meshTenant, all Building Blocks that were added to this meshTenant get deleted too.
