## Ticket Details
### Improve Move Tenant Workspace Selection
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have enhanced moving tenants to make workspace and project context more obvious. The current workspace and 
project name is now more prominently displayed with its identifier and tags for quick recognition.

### Current User Building Block Input
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now use a new "Current User" assignment type for Building Block inputs that automatically provides information 
about the user or API key executing the Building Block. This includes user details like name, email, euid, username, and 
type (user, API key, or API user) in JSON format.

#### How to use
When creating or editing Building Block Definition inputs, select "Current User" as the assignment type. The input will 
automatically receive a JSON object containing details about the current user context. This is useful for auditing, 
personalization, or conditional logic based on who is executing the Building Block.

### New Tenant Usage Reports now Link to Projects Correctly
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, Tenant Usage Reports of recently created tenants were sometimes
not correctly associated to their project. This also resulted in the Tenant
Usage Reports not appearing in the Chargeback Statement of that project. This
has been fixed.

### Use PUT instead of PATCH for updating meshCommDefs
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API now uses a PUT endpoint to update existing meshCommunicationDefinitions, replacing the previous PATCH endpoint. This aligns with our general API conventions. Note that the new PUT endpoint only supports updates - attempting to update a non-existent resource will return a 404.

### Admin API rights for project user and group bindings
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have added new admin-level API permissions that allow API Keys to manage project user and group bindings 
across any workspace through the meshObject API. Previously, these operations were limited to workspace members 
or required broader import permissions.

### Project binding endpoints return HTTP 201 for POST requests
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have updated the project user and group binding API endpoints to return HTTP status code 201 (Created) instead 
of 200 (OK) when successfully creating new bindings via POST requests. This change aligns the API with standard 
HTTP conventions for resource creation.

#### How to use
We don't expect you to apply any change to your integration of the API as long as you don't specifically
verify that the response returns exactly a 200. If you just validate for any success status, your integration
still works. Additionally we noticed, that it was possible to send multiple POST requests to the POST endpoint
for the same binding (same name). But the API docs already stated before, that this is not possible. The implementation
is now adapted accordingly to fail with a 409 (Conflict) if the same binding is already present.

### Allow Project Deletion State Filtering
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A new parameter is available in the meshObject Project API to allow filtering for the
deletion states of projects, similar to how it works for meshTenants.
Please check the API docs for more information.

### Resource and CLI buttons for workspace resources
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We added new resource and CLI buttons to workspace resources in meshPanel. These buttons appear on tenant cards and building 
blocks, providing quick access to external resources and command-line interfaces. The buttons are generated from sign-in URLs 
and resource URLs configured in your platform configurations and building block outputs.

### Show status of resources in workspace overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now display the status of workspace resources (projects, tenants, and building blocks) directly in the workspace 
overview. This provides you with immediate visibility into the current state of your resources without having to 
navigate to individual resource details.

### Remove Summary Field from Building Block Run API (preview)
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We removed the summary field from the building block run API. Since the building block 
run API is still in preview mode and the summary field was never displayed to users, this change should not impact 
your existing workflows.
As a replacement for the summary field, you can now use the new "Summary" assignment type for building block outputs 
to capture and display summary information from your building block runs.

### Fix Known Host Showing up When Using Basic Auth HTTPS
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When using basic authentication with HTTPS for Terraform Building Block Definition, the known host prompt would
pop up, which is not needed in this case. This fix ensures that the known host prompt does not appear in this scenario.

### Fix Payment Method Consumption Status Filtering
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, filtering payment methods by consumption status displayed inconsistent results, including payment methods 
with incorrect consumption status. In this release, the filtering logic has been corrected to ensure that only payment 
methods with the specified consumption status are displayed.
