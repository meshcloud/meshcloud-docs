## Ticket Details
### Simplified Communication Details
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Communication emails are now easier to read and act upon quickly. 
The email subject line clearly displays the communication name, and 
the content has been streamlined to eliminate unnecessary text. You'll 
immediately see what the communication is about and when action is 
needed, without having to parse through boilerplate text.

#### How to use
When you receive a communication email, the subject line now shows 
the exact communication name. The email starts with a clear 
statement like "You received a communication for workspace ABC 
with a due date of January 15" followed directly by the communication 
content. This removes the previous bullet-point format and redundant 
explanatory text, helping you understand and respond to 
communications more efficiently.

### Fixed Building Block Dependency Selection in Creation Wizards
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building block dependencies are now correctly applied when creating tenants or projects, even when the building
blocks don't require any user input. Previously, these dependencies would not be properly selected in such cases.
Additionally, the user experience for recommended building blocks that don't require input has been improved.

### Fixed Duplicate Parent Dependencies for Workspace Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Resolved an issue that caused duplicate parent dependencies to appear for workspace-level building blocks. Workspace 
building blocks now correctly show only unique parent dependencies.

### Improved Building Block Definition List Loading Performance
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We optimized the building block definition list to load faster. You'll notice the improvement 
especially when working with many building block definitions or definitions with numerous inputs, as we reduced 
the data payload to only what's necessary for the list view.
