## Ticket Details
### Fix Building Block Definition Input Copy on Draft Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, creating a draft version did not copy the selectable and default values from the latest version. This issue has now been fixed.

### Display name for Building Block Definition Input
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've enhanced our UI that allows you to provide display names for inputs. During your input configuration, input names such as "CLIENT_SECRET" will auto-generates a more human-readable name like "Client Secret" as an display name. For even greater clarity and customization, you can also specify your own display name or modify the auto-generated one to better suit your needs.
