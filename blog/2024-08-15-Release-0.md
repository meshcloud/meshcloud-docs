## Ticket Details
### Fix Building Blocks with SSH Auth
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
With Release 2024.35.0 a regression was introduced that prevented successful execution of Building Blocks
that used SSH to access Terraform Modules in a Git repository. This issue is fixed now and these Building Blocks
run successfully.

#### How to use
Building Block Runs that were stuck in an In Progress or Pending state after Release 2024.35.0 will automatically
run through with this fix. No manual interaction is needed.

### Fix deletion of "Waiting for Dependency" Building Block
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
It was not possible to delete a Building Block that was in status "Waiting for Dependency". You received an error,
that the Building Block cannot be deleted, when it is in that status. This was a wrong validation made by meshStack
and is fixed now. You can now also successfully delete those Building Blocks.
