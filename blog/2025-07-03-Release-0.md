## Ticket Details
### Migrated GitHub Integrations
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The GitHub Actions integration used to be managed via Platforms.
This has now been migrated to the new Integrations feature which is
more isolated to and easier to manage. This also has the added benefit
that you can directly create the integration when you create
a new building block definition.

### List of integrations
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The recently introduced GitLab integration and also the migrated GitHub integrations
are now visible in one list in the Admin Area & Platform Builder. In an upcoming release
we will also add the ability to create and edit integrations on this screen.

### Fix API Key Sorting by Creation Date
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, the panel returned an error when sorting API keys by their
creation date. This has been fixed.

### Fix euid filter for meshUser endpoint
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Previously, the euid filter of the meshUser endpoint of the meshObject API
did not work correctly. Instead of returning only users with a matching euid,
all users were returned. This was fixed.

### Tag Catalog Support for Users and Groups
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now define tag schemas for users and groups in the tag catalog. This enables you to create policies that 
enforce access rules for users and groups based on their tags, providing better compliance to your teams.

#### How to use
Navigate to the tag catalog in the administration area to create tag schemas for "User / Group" entities. Once 
defined, these schemas can be referenced in policies to create rules that automatically apply to users and 
groups based on their tag values. Note that user and group tags continue to be managed through the existing tag 
configuration and API.

### Enforce User/Group Policies during Project Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We enabled the project role policy evaluation during project creation. If a policy is
defined between a project role and user/group then assignments can only be made to
users/groups to the project if the relationship is compliant.

### Improved User Authorization for Creation Flows
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we have redesigned the authorization flow to provide a more intuitive and efficient experience 
during workspace and project creation. Highlights include a streamlined dropdown interface, user-friendly role 
and expiration date pickers. This UI overhaul preserves all existing capabilities while improving usability 
and reducing friction during workspace and project creation.

### Admin Area Button Stays White When Focused On
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The Admin Area button in the context navigation now maintains its white background color when focused on.
This update enhances visual consistency and improves user experience by preventing the button from turning black during focus states.

### Add Location Name In Platform Filter
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
The location field has been added to platform filter in communication creation to improve platform identification.
This change addresses issues where multiple platforms had the same name.

### Deprecated Platform Notification Subscriptions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The legacy platform notification subscriptions have been removed in user profile section. 
Users will no longer receive notifications through the old system, and all 
notifications should now be managed through the new Communication Center.

### Deprecated Legacy Platform Notifications
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Legacy platform notifications have been deprecated and replaced with the Communication Center. 
When admin users attempt to send notifications to users through the legacy interface, they will 
now be shown a deprecation notice and redirected to the new Communication Center.

### Deprecated Legacy Workspace Messages
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Legacy workspace messages have been deprecated and replaced with the Communication Center. 
When admin users attempt to send messages to workspace users through the legacy interface, they will 
now be shown a deprecation notice and redirected to the new Communication Center.

### Accessible Label For Main Navigation Bar
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To support assistive technologies, like screen readers, 
we have added an accessible name ('Main Navigation') to the main navigation bar.
