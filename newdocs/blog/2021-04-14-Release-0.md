## Ticket Details
### Fix GCP Cost Collection
**Audience:** Operator
**Component:** kraken-worker


#### Description
There was an issue with GCP cost collection, that was caused by infrequent gaps in GCP data delivery.
A mechanism has been introduced to prevent this in the future and make GCP cost collection more
robust against irregular data delivery.

### Bug related to Project-Dashboard-Button fixed
**Audience:** Customer, Partner
**Component:** panel


#### Description
We fixed a Bug related to Project-Dashboard-Button. It was possible to click on a button even if the button was disabled and then a blank screen appeared.

### Improved error messages
**Audience:** User, Operator
**Component:** web


#### Description
The error message system got a general overhaul. This will result in clearer
error messages for the user in the meshPanel.
Please let us know if you encounter error messages which are hard to understand.
We continuously work on improving them for you!
