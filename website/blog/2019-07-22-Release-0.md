## Ticket Details
### Fix report period generation
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** kraken-worker


#### Description
Fixed a bug that caused no more tenant usage report periods to be generated in specific scheduling
conditions.

### Detailed Tenant Usage Reports
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** kraken


#### Description
Detailed Tenant Usage Reports are now available. They show usages per resource. These usages show every
timeframe a resource was actually running. So e.g. that it was running for 3 days then paused for 2 days and running
again for 5 days is what you can see in this detailed report.

#### How to use
The detailed report is linked from every screen where a tenant usage report is shown. E.g. the Project Statements in your
Project Dashboard or the Usage Report of a specific tenant have a link to the details now.

### Removes unnecessary role request approval notification
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In some cases users were shown a notification about customer/project roles requests requiring their approval, even though these requests were already approved.
