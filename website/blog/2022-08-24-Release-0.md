## Ticket Details
### Add report period to meshChargeback line items in API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When retrieving meshChargebacks via the meshObject API, the report period for every line item
is now also included in the response. meshChargebacks can contain line items from different
reporting periods. If for some reason a usage report was not finalized before the related chargeback 
period ended, it will be added to a later chargeback statement once it is finalized.

### Fix resetting optional platform configs
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Resetting an optional platform config value (e.g. the carbon footprint config in GCP metering) did
not completely reset the field and lead to some extensive internal logging. This was fixed.

### Include roles assigned via group in navigation bar
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now include roles assigned via groups in the customer roles displayed in the navigation bar.
Previously, only roles directly assigned to your user were visible.
