## Ticket Details
### Fixed some tags not being able to be mandatory
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description

### Single-select tag fields can be cleared
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Values in tag fields that have the type "Single-Select" can now be cleared out. This means users can set an empty value to the field. (This does not apply to mandatory tags)

**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Besides being able to see the landing zone name in the list of tenants, the detailed view of a single tenant
now also contains this piece of information.
