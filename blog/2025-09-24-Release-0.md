## Ticket Details
### Allow Tenant Import Into Custom Platforms Without Mandatory Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixed a regression that prevented importing tenants into custom platforms when the landing zone
does not have any mandatory building blocks. This functionality was previously available but was
inadvertently blocked by an overly restrictive check. Imports are still correctly blocked for
landing zones with mandatory building blocks due to technical limitations.

### Fixed Building Block Execution Loop Issue
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where some building blocks would get stuck for hours in a continuous loop of re-execution. This was caused by 
non-deterministic ordering of user roles and unnecessary tenant replications when platform tenant IDs were already set.

#### How to use
Building blocks that were previously stuck in execution loops will now run normally. You don't need to take any action - 
the fix is automatically applied to all existing building blocks.

### Enable Editing Assignment Type for Building Block Outputs in Draft Mode
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where you could not edit the assignment type of building block definition outputs when the
definition version was in draft mode and not related to a custom platform. This is fixed now and you can always 
edit the assignment type for outputs when your building block definition is in draft mode.

### Improved Terraform Variable Detection for Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've enhanced the reliability of automatic variable detection when importing 
Terraform configurations into Building Block Definitions. Previously, certain 
complex Terraform expressions could cause parsing errors and prevent the 
system from properly detecting your variables. This improvement ensures that 
your Building Block Definitions work seamlessly, even when using advanced 
Terraform syntax.

### Refresh Buttons for Building Block Lists
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have added refresh buttons to the workspace building blocks and tenant building blocks overview pages. These 
buttons allow you to quickly refresh the building block list without having to reload the entire page.

### Fix AWS Landing Zone Creation via Platform Builder
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when an AWS Landing Zone was created from within the Platform Builder, an error was
displayed saying that awsEnrollAccount is a required property. This has been fixed.

### Hide Building Blocks Without User Input From Creation Wizards
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Building blocks that don't require any user input are now automatically hidden from the project 
and tenant creation wizards. This streamlines the creation process by only showing building blocks 
that actually need configuration from users, reducing visual clutter and improving the overall user 
experience.

### Workspace Building Block Preselected by Default during Definition Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When creating a new building block definition, the Workspace Building Block 
type is now preselected by default instead of the Tenant Building Block type. 
This improves the onboarding experience as Workspace Building Block serves usually 
as the starting point for new platform teams.

### Auto-select Current Workspace when Returning from meshStack Hub
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When you return to meshStack after browsing building block definitions in meshStack Hub, we now automatically
pre-select your current workspace in the workspace picker. This eliminates the need to manually select your
workspace in most cases, providing a smoother workflow when importing building block definitions from the Hub.

### Fix GitHub Workflow Validation for Building Block Definition Purge Mode
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Fixed validation logic for GitHub workflow building block definitions when switching between deletion modes. 
The "Destroy Workflow" field is now correctly marked as optional when using "Purge in meshStack" mode, 
preventing validation errors that previously blocked form submission.

### Improve Admin UI layout and extend app background
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This release contains a collection of UI updates and layout improvements that
standardize the administration screens to the Control Plane UI layout and
improves the main application background behavior.

### Enable SSH Authentication for Terraform Modules in Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We now forward the configured SSH key (used to clone the primary Building Block repository) into the Terraform execution environment.
This allows Terraform to fetch additional private modules (for example via git::ssh URLs) using the same key, without further configuration.
No action is required; runs that previously failed with permission errors when downloading private modules should now succeed.

### Improved Default View Toggle for Workspace Overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We redesigned the default view toggle functionality in the workspace overview to provide a better user experience. 
The toggle now shows more intuitive text that clearly indicates the current state and available action. When you 
switch from the new workspace overview back to the old view, we'll ask for your feedback to help us understand 
how we can improve the new experience.

### Default Settings for Feature Previews
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Admins can now set default preferences for feature previews to streamline the user experience. You can configure 
feature previews to be enabled by default for new users and those who haven't made a decision yet, or clear 
default settings to let users opt-in individually. This helps platform teams control the default feature 
experience while respecting existing user preferences.

### Fixed multiple scrollbars in Admin Area sidebar
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Resolved an issue where expanding all sidebar entries in the Admin Area resulted in two scrollbars appearing. Now only the sidebar content is scrollable, providing a cleaner and more intuitive user experience.
