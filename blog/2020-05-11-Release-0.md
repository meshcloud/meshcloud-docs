## Ticket Details
### Invited users euid can be set to the users email
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** web


#### Description
meshStack can now be configured to setup the newly invited users E-Mail directly as the external user id.
This allows direct cloud synchronization of this user for Azure and GCP without requiring him to login first.

### Totals per replication status in tenant list
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
Tenant list now shows totals per replication status based on applied filters (if any filters are used).

### Provide AWS and GCP access without meshPanel login
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
So far users always had to login at least once to meshPanel before they were able to access tenants in the cloud
platforms. For Azure and GCP, access is now granted directly to users that are imported via
meshObject import, if an euid is set for these users via the import.

### GCP replicator removes initial project owner roles
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** gcp


#### Description
Projects created by the GCP replicator contain a default “owner” role binding for the
meshfed-service user. A change to IAM policy reconciliation behavior introduced in meshStack v7.15.0 caused
these default role bindings to be no longer removed during reconciliation. This release fixes the behavior
to remove default role bindings during reconciliation.

#### How to use
This issue only affects GCP projects created by meshStack versions >= v7.15.0 and before this release.
GCP operators do not need to take manual action, meshStack will remove any default role bindings during
the next project replication.

### Add addtional columns to payment methods overview
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
The payment methods overview in the administration area shows now the creator and the amount value.

### meshUser api import supports external UserId
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
We've extended the meshUser object api to provide an optional euid ("external user identifier").

### Fixes Azure reponse deserialization
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** azure


#### Description
Fixed a deserialization error triggered by rare response data during the Blueprint assignment.
