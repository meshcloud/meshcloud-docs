## Ticket Details
### Tenant Usage Report Rights
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Operators can now configure rights for viewing cloud tenant usage reports
via meshCustomer groups.

#### How to use
Include the right "TENANTUSAGEREPORT_LIST_PROJECT" or "TENANTUSAGEREPORT_LIST_CUSTOMER"
in a group to enable users to view Tenant usage reports from the tenant view in the panel
or in the Customer administration area respectively. meshStack default configuration 
assigns these rights to the "Customer Employee" and "Customer Admin" groups.
The panel will hide the corresponding menu items based on the presence of these rights.

### Invitation Link for new Customers
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** web


#### Description
Adds a special invitation link to allow newly generated customers to be directly associated with a partner account.

#### How to use
As a Partner go to the Administration Area, on the menu there is the new option 'Customer Invite'. Here you find the link which
can be shared with new users who should be enabled to register a new Customer who will automatically get added to the partner account.

### Add the Tenant Customer Reports in Admin Area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Inside the Admin Area under Platforms -> Usage Reports you can see the usage reports of your customers.

### User-Confirmation of upgraded Role Assignment
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
It is possible to configure meshStack to enforce a user approval, before a new Customer Role Request is accepted and the role assignment is applied. This user confirmation is only needed when the new role has a higher rank and therefore implicitly assigns more responsibility to the user.

### Enforce correct cost centers and wa numbers
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
In order to enhance data quality for billing purposes a notification has been added to the dashboards
in UPS. It appears when either the cost center of the customer or cost center or wa number set on a project
is ivalid. A cost center must always be a 4-digit number. The WA number is optional and must be a 6-digit
number if set. Please adapt all your projects to these new conditions asap. Additionally you will receive
an email once, if you have projects or customers with invalid payment information.

#### How to use
The notifications contain links to your customer's payment method screen and to the affected project edit
screens. This allows quick access to relevant places where you have to fix payment info.

### Fixed multiline text in CSV export
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
When project tags contained multiline strings, some tools for reading CSV did not process the
quoted text with line breaks correctly. Therefore the CSV export has been changed to always replace
linebreaks with spaces in the project tags.

### Cost Center and WA number have to be provided for projects
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** web


#### Description
In the past either a cost center or a WA number had to be provided for projects. In order
to process billing correctly for all cloud platforms both infos are required now. When creating
or editing a project, you always have to provide cost center and WA number from now on. Existing projects
have to update their cost information on projects.

### Fix communication log for service instance updates
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Service Instance updates have written incorrect communication logs. The operation type was
PROVISION_INSTANCE instead of UPDATE_INSTANCE. This has been fixed. Existing communication logs
have been updated accordingly.

### Highlight pending customer role requests
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Customer navigation menu shows now a badge with the sum of all pending customer role requests.

### Location-Chooser appearence improvement
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
When creating projects the location list now looks nicer.

### Customer user role requests are now available
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Customer Admins, as well as Partners are able to accept/decline customer role requests when 4-EP was enabled.

### Add customer contact to exported projects
**Audience:** Partner<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
CSV exports now include customer contacts for each project, so that every project has a contact user even if all project users were removed.

### Expiring service bindings
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
Service brokers a can now provide service plans with expirings bindings. Service bindings for such services will expire after a period of days specified by the service plan and will be automatically deleted.

### Display of shelved OpenStack instances fixed
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
OpenStack instances in status SHELVED or SHELVED_OFFLOADED broke the OpenStack instances screen in meshPlanel. This is fixed now.

### mesh Database
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This release makes use of a new mesh database that centrally stores
desired and actual states of objects orchestrated by meshStack.
This requires changes to your meshStack deployment and configuration.

### User Registration only via meshIdB
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>**Component:** e2e


#### Description
In order to provide a unified approach of user handling in meshstack, we moved the registration
of a user to the meshIdB. This only applies to meshstack installations which are not using an upstream
identity provider, ldap, or similar. meshIdB already provides all required features like email verification, forgot
password, etc.

#### How to use
The registration is now divided up into 2 steps. Users have to register first via meshIdB and confirm their email address.
This also applies when accepting an invitation as a new user. Only logged in users are able to accept invitations. After successful
user registration and login with that user, the home screen contains a link for creating a meshCustomer. Only a few
customer related information must be provided in this step and after submitting this meshCustomer registration,
the user has access to the newly created meshCustomer.

### Highlighting of expired project user roles
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Project user roles that will expire soon (expiry date in < 7 days) will be highlighted in **yellow**. Already expired project user roles will be highlighted in **red**. Additionally notifications for these expired and soon to expire project roles will be shown on the Customer Dashboard and the My Projects screen.

### Expiring Service Bindings
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Service Brokers can optionally configure service plans to have an expiration (in days). Service bindings for these plans will be automatically deleted after the specified period. This can be useful for enforcing credential rolling.

### Improves AWS platform error messages
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Improves the qualitity of AWS error messages facing the user when working with this platform.
