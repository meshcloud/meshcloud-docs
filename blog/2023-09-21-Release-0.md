## Ticket Details
### Fix Terraform Building Block Definition Creation
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
With the last release a bug was introduced, that prevented creation of Building Block Definitions of type Terraform.
This is fixed now.

### Set Expiration Date During Workspace Role Change
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, it was possible to change the role of existing Workspace members
via the panel without specifying an expiration date of the user role, despite
recertification settings on the Settings page being applied. This has now been
fixed.

### Fix editing of Dependent Building Block Input
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
When you added an input of type "Building Block Output" to a Building Block Definition and reloaded the Inputs tab
of the Building Block Definition control plane, the dropdown value for this input was empty and the input was shown
as invalid. This is fixed now and the correct value is shown.

### Delete Building Block in Building Block Control Plane
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
Administrators can now delete any building blocks in the building block control plane in the Admin Area.

#### How to use
To delete your Building Block, go to the control plane of a specific Building Block and go to "Deletion". Depending on how the deletion mode is set up, your Building Block will either delete resources or be purged in meshStack. Even if your building block is set up to delete resources, you can always still choose to purge it.

### Fix for filtering Building Blocks by version
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
It was not possible to filter Building Blocks by version when providing the "v" prefix. You were able
to search for version "2", but searching for version "v2" did not work. This is fixed now.

### Fix Display of Workspace Event Details
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Previously, when you go to Oragnization > Workspaces in the Admin Area and selected the History of a Workspace, you encountered an empty page when attempting to access the event details. This has been fixed.

### Workspace Status Column
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
With the change, we have added a dedicated "Status" column to the Workspaces page on the Admin Area, allowing you 
to easily distinguish between active and deleted workspaces for a clearer overview.

### Improves GCP tenant deletion resilience
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
This fixes a bug that could leave GCP tenants stuck in deletion, in case some API
calls to the GCP API failed in the background.

### List tags for Partner Employees
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
Partner Employees are now able to list all tags in the Admin Area. They will not be able to create or edit tags.

### Building Block dependencies on version level
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
You can now manage dependencies between Building Blocks per Building Block Definition Version.
This results in a more flexible approach that also enables you to add dependencies to required
Building Blocks in later versions, even in cases where a previous version did not contain such
a dependency.

### Bulk Run Building Blocks
**Audience:** Partner, Operator


#### Description
In the Admin Area's Building Block list, you can now also bulk run Building Blocks.

#### How to use
Select or filter for the Building Blocks you want to run again, click on Actions and pick "Start new Run".
This will run all selected Building Blocks again.

### Filter for Building Blocks that require operator input
**Audience:** Operator, Partner


#### Description
The Building Block list in the Admin Area now supports filtering for "Waiting for Operator". As part of that 
change, there is now also a separate state for "Waiting for Dependency" when the Building Block is waiting for a 
dependency to finish running successfully. Before, you could only find these specific Building Blocks that require 
operator input in the Admin Area's Tenant list. To accommodate for this change, we have also removed the Building 
Block filtering capabilities in the Tenant List, in favor of the new Building Block list. Additionally, the 
"Actions Needed" section in the Cloud Foundation Dashboard in the Admin Area now also links to the new Building 
Block list.
