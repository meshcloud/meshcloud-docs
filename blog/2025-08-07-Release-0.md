## Ticket Details
### Fixed User Input Updateability for GitHub and GitLab Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented the setting of "updateable by workspace user" property for inputs on GitHub and GitLab
building blocks. This feature was previously only working for Terraform building blocks.

### Clickable Links for Workspace and Project in Admin Area Tables
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Workspace and project names or identifiers in admin area tables are now clickable links, enabling direct navigation without 
needing to manually search between tables.

### Fixed meshStack Hub Back Reference Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where clicking "Get started with building blocks from the hub" button in the building block
definition overview screen would not properly set the back reference for definition imports. The navigation
now correctly opens the hub in a new window and establishes proper communication between meshPanel and the
hub for a better user experience.

### Fixes Workspace Building Block Dependency Selection for Tenant Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed a regression that prevented you from selecting workspace building blocks when creating tenant
building blocks.

### More Granular Tenant Import Permissions for API Keys
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the authorization model for tenant imports in the meshObject API by introducing granular
permissions. You can now control tenant import operations with dedicated import permissions, in addition to standard
tenant save permissions. This change gives you better security and control over who can import unmanaged platform tenants.

#### How to use
You can now manage tenant import permissions based on landing zone ownership:

- "Admin: Allow importing an unmanaged platform tenant when creating a Tenant using any Landing Zone."
- "Allow importing an unmanaged platform tenant when creating a Tenant using any Landing Zone owned by this Workspace."

Based on your feedback, we removed the previous permission "Admin: When creating Tenants in this Workspace, allow importing unmanaged Tenants from any platform" in favor of these permissions that account for Landing Zone ownership.

For backward compatibility, existing API Keys and API Users have been granted these new permissions automatically
where required to retain their previous capabilities. We recommend reviewing API Key permissions and removing any import permissions not required for your use cases.

### Improved Test Git Connection for Private Repositories
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where the "Test Git Connection" button remained enabled in building block definitions even when
no valid SSH key was present.
The button now correctly stays disabled until a valid SSH key is selected, and a tooltip explains when the key
needs to be re-uploaded.

### Complete UX Revision of Recently Introduced Workspace Overview
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've completely redesigned the workspace overview to provide a cleaner, more intuitive experience. The new design 
adds a hierarchical structure where project resources are nested inside project boxes.

### Building Block Author Input Replaces Current User Input
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've improved Building Block input reliability by replacing the "Current User" input assignment type with "Author". 
Building Blocks now receive information about who originally created the Building Block instead of whoever is currently 
executing it. This provides more consistent and predictable user data for your Building Block automations.

#### How to use
Existing Building Blocks using the "Current User" input type will be automatically migrated to use "Author" input. 
No action is required from your side. When creating new Building Block Definitions, you'll now see "Author" instead 
of "Current User" in the input assignment type dropdown. The Author input provides the same user information structure 
but refers to the Building Block creator rather than the current executor, ensuring consistent data across all runs.

Note: The type values in the JSON output have also changed from uppercase format (e.g., "USER", "API_KEY") to camel 
case format ("User", "ApiKey", "ApiUser", "System"). If your Building Block logic depends on these type values, 
please update accordingly.

### Improved error handling for Terraform file import
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the error messages shown when meshStack encounters an internal error while parsing
Terraform files during automatic input detection.

### Reduced Azure Permissions for Administrative Units
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved the security posture of meshStack by reducing the required Azure permissions for Administrative Unit
operations. The Azure integration now uses more specific Microsoft Graph APIs that require fewer permissions while
maintaining the same functionality for user and group management within Administrative Units.

### Less prominent autogenerated display name of building blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Display names for building blocks are still autogenerated from the definition name. 
Unlike before, the field is no longer shown as a visible input by default, 
it's now tucked behind an edit toggle to reduce visual clutter while keeping customization possible.

### Enhanced Integration Management for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Platform Engineers can now edit existing integrations and manage them more effectively through new UI components.

#### How to use
Navigate to the integration management area (which is present both in the admin area menu as well as in the platform builder area)
where you can now click on integration names to edit their configurations.
When attempting to delete an integration that is referenced by Building Block Definition Versions, you will receive a
error message explaining that deletion is not currently supported to protect your existing Building Block
configurations.

### Fix for Incorrect Validation Error Display
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This update resolves a display issue affecting building block
outputs of type list. Previously, a "failed validation step"
message was incorrectly shown, even when validation had not failed.

### Event retention and automatic cleanup enabled
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A bug prevented the automatic deletion of old events which is done to improve system performance and compliance.
This was fixed and events older than the configured retention period (typically 5 years) are now automatically
removed from the system on a weekly schedule.

### Fixed Stuck Building Block Run Issue
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A rare race condition could occasionally cause building block
runs to remain in the "pending" or "in progress" state for an
extended period. This issue has now been resolved.
