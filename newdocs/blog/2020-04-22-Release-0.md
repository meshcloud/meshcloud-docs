## Ticket Details
### Avoid duplicate cost collection from AWS
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
In some cases cost lineItems from AWS have been processed multiple times
and lead to duplicated costs in usage report. This has been fixed.

### Consistently style forms containing metadata tags
**Audience:** User, Customer, Operator
**Component:** panel


#### Description
Forms containing organization-specific <a href="https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshcloud.metadata-tags.html">metadata tags</a>
like the project create wizard now style metadata tag form fields the same way as built-in form fields.

#### How to use
This change helps operators to provide a more seamless user experience for their meshStack implementations
when using organization-specific metadata tag schemas. This means Customer Admins won't see any difference between
e.g. meshProject core fields like "name" and any organization-specific metadata fields (e.g. a "product-id").
