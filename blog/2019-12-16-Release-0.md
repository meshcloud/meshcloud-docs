## Ticket Details
### Show deactivated status for service brokers
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
Deactivated service brokers will now be marked as such in the published service brokers overview.

### Azure role name alias
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** replicator


#### Description
It has already been possible to configure how managed Azure groups should be named and to use the name of the specific meshRole represented by that group. Now it's also possible to specify azure specific aliases for these role names which will be used when naming groups.

### Tenant numbers of azure subscriptions/groups
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Projects can use running tenant numbers to identify them per assigned platform. Tenant numbers can be used when naming managed subscriptions and groups.

### Fix AWS role replication for multi-role mapping
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Fixes a replication issue which could occur if you mapped multiple meshProject roles to a single
AWS role. The problem could prevent successful project role replication.

### Invitation of external user
**Audience:** Customer<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
For some public cloud platforms also external users shall be invitable to meshProjects. External users are
not available in the company user directory and can therefore not log in to meshPanel. But they will get access
on the cloud platform directly. This makes e.g. sense in Azure, when you want to invite a Microsoft Support user
to your subscription. This feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled for a meshStack installation.

### Azure Group Names can be customized
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Platform Operator can now customize the generated Azure group names in the platform instance configuration. For detailed
information about the available options please see the Azure platform documentation.

### Improves AWS Access Stack handling in Landing Zone
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
If the Access Stack fails to apply the AWS replication tries to remove and re-apply it again. This works automatically as long as the MeshstackAccountAccessRole owns all needed access rights for the Access Stack.

### AWS Access Stack deploy retry improvements
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
Under certain circumstances a failed AWS Access Stack deployment was not retried.

### Tenant Service Broker
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>**Component:** panel


#### Description
Tenant-aware service broker are now supported! That means users of the meshMarketplace can select their meshTenants
for services that support tenant bindings. These service brokers can then e.g. spin up certain resources within
the tenant (e.g. an OnPrem Connect). They could also use the tenant information for e.g. a CI/CD service broker,
who needs access to the actual tenants. More details about Tenant Service Broker can be found in the meshcloud
documentation.

### Adds customizable Azure Subscription Names
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The Azure subscription names can now be customized via the Azure Platform Instance config by an operator.
You can use a format-string syntax. For more information please look into the meshStack Azure documentation.

### GCP integration hits GA
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
meshStack's GCP Integration is now officially generally available. Operators can head over over to the documentation 
to learn how to provide managed GCP projects for their organization with meshStack.

### Project roles can be freely configured
**Audience:** Operator<br>**Component:** deploy


#### Description
User project roles (i.e. admin, user, ...) can now be freely configured, including the initally assigned role.
