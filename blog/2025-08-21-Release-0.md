## Ticket Details
### API Key permissions for meshWorkspaceBindings
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
We extended the set of available permissions for API Keys
by the required permissions to manage meshWorkspaceBindings.

### Opt-In for Workspace Overview as Default Landing Page
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Users can now set the workspace overview as their default landing page when accessing a workspace.
Previously, users would always land on the projects page when entering a workspace. With this enhancement,
users can choose to have the new overview page as their default view, providing quicker access to key
workspace information and metrics. This new overview will become the default for all users on 17.09.2025.
