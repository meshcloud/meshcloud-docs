## Ticket Details
### Timeout Increased for Building Block Runs
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
An internal change in the communication between services made it necessary
to increase the timeout for building block runs, the previous timeout was
too short and could lead to double execution of runs if the Terraform script
execution took too long.

### Provide Detailed Status on Building Blocks
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
This powerful new capability enables Platform Engineers to deliver detailed execution information for a Building Block to its consumers. Using the new BuildingBlockRuns API endpoint, you can provide real-time updates on runs and individual steps, displaying progress or offering detailed error reports to users and operators.

Please note that this functionality is currently in BETA. If you have any feedback, feel free to reach out.

### Misleading Required Tag Indicator Fixed
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We've fixed an issue where optional tags showed a red stripe for empty field, implying they were required. Now, the red stripe 
only appears for required fields or invalid input and will no longer show for empty optional fields.
