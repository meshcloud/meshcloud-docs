## Ticket Details
### Fixes issue which prevented project deletion
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes an issue which caused the resource existence check to fail from time to time. The resource existence check
happens when you list resources in the projects page in the Account area and during project deletion. Because of this,
this issue cased the project deletion to fail from time to time as well.

### Azure Subscription Tagging
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Azure Subscriptions can now be tagged directly using configurable tags during a meshProject 
replication. This helps identifying and organizing subscriptions based on third 
party information.
