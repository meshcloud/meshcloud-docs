## Ticket Details
### Fix Communications not being shown inside Panel
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
For customers that have the communication center light activated,
communications were not shown inside the workspace area. The recipient was
only made aware of the communication via e-mail but did not see the
communication anywhere inside the panel. This has been fixed.

### Reject unknown inputs for Building Block API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The meshObject API for building blocks will now respond
with a Bad Request status code in case a building block
should be created but the request body contains an input
that is not defined on the respective building block
definition version.

### Keyboard Navigation for Table Column Sort Arrows
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This feature allows users to navigate through table column sort arrows using the keyboard.
Users can use the Tab key to focus on the sort arrows and the Enter key to activate them.

### Keyboard Navigation for Object Selection
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The breadcrumb and all interactive elements, including "Create Workspace", "Create Project" and "Create Tenant"
menu button, are now focusable and operable using the keyboard.

### Fix Duplicate E-Mails after Communication Creation
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, when a communication was created within the communication center,
users could receive the same e-mail twice if they were assigned to a given
workspace both via the Workspace Manager and via the Workspace Owner role.
This issue has been fixed.

### Azure Blueprint Deletion Now Supported in Landing Zones
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now delete Azure Blueprint configurations from Azure Landing Zones in meshPanel. Previously, blueprints 
could only be added or edited, but not removed.

#### How to use
When editing an Azure Landing Zone, you can now use the close button to remove blueprint configurations from 
the blueprints list. Please be aware that deleting a blueprint configuration in meshStack will not automatically 
deprovision already provisioned blueprints from existing Azure subscriptions. You may need to manually clean up 
these resources if required.
