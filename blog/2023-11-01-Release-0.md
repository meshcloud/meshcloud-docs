## Ticket Details
### Add Emergency Admin User to Workspace after expiration
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, admins were unable to add themselves as emergency users if they were already assigned to a workspace with an expiration date that had passed. Now, admins can successfully add themselves as emergency users, even if they were previously assigned to that workspace.

### Remove expired Workspace Accesses
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, if you tried to remove expired accesses of Users/Group under "Current Access" on your workspace control plane, . has resulted in not found issues. This has been fixed.

### Improve Building Block Azure Auth Input generation
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When you now generate Azure auth inputs for a Building Block Definition, the ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
input is additionally generated as a static input. It is required to tell the Terraform Provider in which
subscription the backend for the Terraform state is located.

### Colored Marking for Expired/Soon-to-Expire Workspace Access
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Identifying expired or soon-to-expire entities within your workspace could be a time-consuming task, leading to potential oversight in access management. Therefore, we have introduced a color-coded marking system, similar to the project access. Expired or soon-to-expire entities are now visually highlighted, making it easy to identify them at a glance. Now you can easily address expiring permissions and maintain a secure workspace environment.

### Fix broken replication for Tenants with re-used identifier
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
This fixes a regression that was introduced with v2023.20.0, that prevented tenants
that had a reused identifier (this happens if they are deleted and recreated again 
in the same project) from correctly displaying the replication result.

### Fix broken Workspace creation for new Users
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that a new user, who has never been assigned to any workspace could not 
create a new workspace.

### Show your own platform types in charts
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
Before this change, all platform types that were build on your own, were shown only as one block in the 
Tenant Dashboard of the Admin Area. Now they are shown individually like any other platform type.

### Auto-Generate Platform Type identifier from name
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When creating a new Platform Type, you can now enter the display name first and the identifier will
be auto-generated based on the display name. You can still modify the identifier as you like, but in
many cases the default might just be what you want to have.

### Converted Currencies on Dashboards
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With this change, all foreign currencies will be now be converted to base
currency (EUR) to have an aligned view on all costs.

### Added Current User Groups to SCIM User Schema Response
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
With this update, the SCIM user schema response will also include the current user groups, 
which will provide you with immediate visibility into the full user's group list.

### Remove empty box on platform tenant screen
**Audience:** User, Customer<br>

#### Description
We removed an empty box on the platform tenant screen that
was shown for tenants on platforms without platform tag support.

### Create new Platform Type from Building Block Definition
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now also create a new Platform Type from the Supported Platform dropdown of Building Block Definitions.
The new Platform Type can be created during Building Block Definition creation and when editing a Building Block
Definition Draft. You can create a concrete Platform after you created your Building Block Definition. More guidance
in meshStack to support you with that will follow soon.

### Bugfix for sorting projects by workspace
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, the panel returned an error when you tried to sort projects by the
Workspace name in the Admin Area. This has now been fixed.
