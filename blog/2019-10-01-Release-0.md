## Ticket Details
### Platform Usage Reports
**Audience:** Operator, Partner<br>**Component:** billing

A new usages overview for Platform Owner and Operator is now available. It summarizes all usages in their platform per usage type (e.g. per flavor of a vm, etc).

two subscriptions were created when replicating a new meshProject to Azure using only one and abandoning 
the other. This problem was fixed.
