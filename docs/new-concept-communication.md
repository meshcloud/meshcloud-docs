> **Note:**

Communications in meshStack provide a structured way to manage and deliver messages to users across different platforms and workspaces. Communications can be sent out by administrators via the admin area and platform engineers via the platform builder.

## Communication Center

The communication center is the central place for creating and managing communications to application teams within meshStack. It allows administrators and platform engineers to get in touch with application teams at scale and track progress.

## Communication Types

There are two main types of communications in meshStack:

1. **Notification**: Enables broadcasting of messages such as maintenance windows and new functionality. Notifications can be delivered through UI and email, and tailored to specific roles or application teams for maximum relevance and reduced noise.

2. **Action Required**: Automates assignment of actionable tasks including security reviews, access validation, and metadata accuracy checks. These tasks ensure compliance and accountability by embedding ownership directly into workflows, providing stakeholders with real-time visibility into progress and reducing manual tracking overhead. You can also assign a due date to the action required communication to ensure timely completion.
