## Ticket Details
### More tolerant timeouts for calls to cloud platforms
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Sometimes calls to cloud platforms can take more time than usual. The previously configured timeouts in the meshStack
were too tight. Errors like "RESTEASY004655 - Unable to invoke request" were the consequence in some platforms. The
increased timeouts should avoid errors like this in most cases. The performance of the communication with the cloud
platforms will be investigated and fixed separately.
