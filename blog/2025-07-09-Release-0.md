## Ticket Details
### Filter User/Groups During Project Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this release, the list of users and groups is now prefiltered during project creation based on tags assigned 
to the project. This enhancement applies when access policies are in place that restrict certain types of users 
or groups, helping ensure only relevant options are shown.

### Updated meshObject API deprecation timelines
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have removed the deprecation timeline for meshBuildingBlock v1 and meshTenant v3.
We will announce deprecation dates for these APIs only once the next version of these APIs come out of preview.

#### How to use
Check the API documentation for announced deprecations and timelines.

### Removed "Add Myself" Button
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The Add Myself button has been removed from project and workspace creation to simplify authorization flow. Users 
can add themselves with their intended role via the Add Users button. The user creating a workspace will continue 
to be automatically added as a Workspace Owner.

### Hides disabled landing zones by default
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Landing zones now have a 'Status' column. Disabled landing zones are now hidden by default in the UI.
Users can still view disabled landing zones by enabling the "Disabled" option.

### Sensitive File Inputs for Building Blocks
**Audience:** User, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
There was a regression issue where FILE inputs for
building block definitions could not be made sensitive
when creating or updating building block definitions.
This has been fixed.

### Fixed GitHub App PEM file handling
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Newly Created building block definitions using GitHub App PEM files no longer fail at the "Trigger GitHub Action" step.

### Fix API Key Sorting by Workspace Name
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, sorting API Keys by their workspace did not work correctly. This
has been fixed.
