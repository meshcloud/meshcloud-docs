## Ticket Details
### Further Enhanced Workspace Overview User Experience
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We've improved the workspace overview with several enhancements to make it easier for you to find and manage your
resources. The overview now features enhanced sorting that prioritizes newly created resources, making it easy to
spot recent additions. Search functionality has been enhanced with highlighted search terms in results, making it
quicker to locate specific resources. Additionally, we've updated the visual design to make it more attractive.

### Prevent Operator File Input Upload During Building Block Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The file upload form is now hidden during creation for operator inputs, as these files are meant to
be set later in the admin or platform builder area.

### Fix Issue in Landing Zone Overview
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
If multiple landing zones with the exact same name existed, the overview of
landing zones was sometimes not displayed correctly. For example, it could
happen that a landing zone was shown twice or not shown at all. This has been
fixed.
