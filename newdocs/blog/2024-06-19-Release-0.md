## Ticket Details
### Fix for Building Block List in Workspace
**Audience:** User


#### Description
In this release, we have resolved an issue with the building block endpoint. Previously, the endpoint only provided building blocks if the building block definition was also owned by the same workspace. This issue has been addressed, and now the API correctly provides all building blocks for the specified workspace or project.

### Fix group deletion on failed group replications
**Audience:** User


#### Description
Previously, when the group replications failed, it inadvertently triggers group deletion. This has been fixed.

### Manage Service Instances with API keys
**Audience:** User


#### Description
You can now use your API keys to manage service instances
within your workspace.

### Improve Notifications for Building Block Definitions
**Audience:** User


#### Description
You will now receive notifications immediately upon being added as subscribers to a Building Block Definition.

### Fix in Building Block list API
**Audience:** User


#### Description
We updated the API endpoint for retrieving Building Blocks.
Previously, the filter by 'workspaceIdentifier' was not working.
This has been fixed now.

### Fix Building Block Definition Deletion
**Audience:** User


#### Description
Previously, you encountered an error when attempting to delete a building block definition that is mandatory in a landing zone on a deleted platform. This issue has been fixed.

### Building Block definition repos on Azure DevOps
**Audience:** User, Operator


#### Description
Fixes a problem with private key formats that made it impossible to use Git repos hosted on Azure DevOps with SSH authentication for Building Block definitions.

### Visible Marketplace Applicable Policies
**Audience:** User


#### Description
In this release, we display active policies in the marketplace, if they exist. With this, you can see 
what policies apply to your marketplace. Note that some Platforms and Building Blocks may not be shown 
due to these policies.

### Manage Building Blocks with API Keys
**Audience:** User


#### Description
You can now use your API Keys to manage (create and delete) Building Blocks
within your workspace. More objects will be supported soon.
