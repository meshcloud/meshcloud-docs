## Ticket Details
### README Support in the Marketplace
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Platform teams can now provide a markdown README for building block definitions. This README is useful for providing usage instructions and other relevant information to users. Platform services built using Open Service Broker API can leverage the new README section in the marketplace via the 'longDescription' field of the OSB Catalog.

### Fix Enabling Due Date for Notifications
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
There was an issue where a due date could be retained when switching the communication type from "Action Required" 
to "Notification" in the Communication Creation Wizard.
This fix ensures that when the type is changed to "Notification", the due date field 
is hidden and any previously set due date is cleared.
