## Ticket Details
### Improve IDP user lookup fallback
**Audience:** User


#### Description
Usually multiple sources are used when a user lookup is performed in the panel.
This fixes a bug that prevented the fallback to other sources in case one of the
sources returned an error.

### Filter meshUsers in API based on user attributes
**Audience:** User


#### Description
It is now possible to filter meshUsers in the API based on attributes like email, firstName, lastName, and more.
