## Ticket Details
### Policy violation message shown when creating a customer
**Audience:** Partner
**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Previously, when creating a customer and an error occurs because of a policy violation, the reason was not properly
shown. This is now fixed and properly formatted so the user can know the reason and do the necessary correction.

### meshObject APIs always have page parameters in 'self' link
**Audience:** User
**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
When making use of page parameters (eg. page=2 and size=1) in the external API, these parameters might be  missing in the 'self' link
of returned response. This problem is solved now and the 'self' link will always contain the correct parameters.

### Fixes incorrect username being set during role assignment
**Audience:** User


#### Description
There was an issue which caused the wrong username to be set when a user is newly added to meshStack
via customer role assignment on the panel. This happened if Azure Active Directory was configured as an identity
source and the username was derived from an attribute that was coming from AAD. This issue has been fixed with this
release and the username is now set correctly on the user.

### Fixes issue when declining customer role request
**Audience:** User


#### Description
Customer role request removal failed for users with no other pending or assigned binding requests, if that user
had previously received a customer message. This issue has been fixed and customer role requests for such users
can be removed via the panel.

### Adding and changing tags are now always visible immediately
**Audience:** Partner
**Component:** release-notes


#### Description
After you have added or modified a tag, you can now verify the changes instantly in the "Tags"-section of a meshObject. In some cases, a page refresh was required, which is now fixed. You can either create or edit a meshObject (e.g Project) and check the "Tags"-section of it to verify your changed tag(s).

### Fixes issue in meshCustomer deletion
**Audience:** User


#### Description
There was an issue in the meshCustomer deletion if the customer had a user assigned and the user was deleted
from the partner area at some point. This issue has been fixed and you can now delete such customers.
