## Ticket Details
### Platform Usage Reports
**Audience:** Operator, Partner
**Component:** billing


#### Description
A new usages overview for Platform Owner and Operator is now available. It summarizes all usages in their platform per usage type (e.g. per flavor of a vm, etc).

### Automatically Role Assignment for 2 Customer in 4EP mode
**Audience:** User


#### Description
When the 4-eyes-principle mode for project role assignments was active with only two existing customer admins it was not possible for them assign each other roles.
This was fixed: If only two admins exist they are now automatically assigned the requested role to avoid this problem.

### Sorting of Tenant Usage Reports
**Audience:** Partner
**Component:** kraken


#### Description
Tenant Usage Reports in the Administration Area can now be sorted by "total".

### Fixes creation of duplicate Azure Subscriptions
**Audience:** User, Operator
**Component:** repli


#### Description
When the communication with the Azure API had failed in the exact moment, there was the possibility that
two subscriptions were created when replicating a new meshProject to Azure using only one and abandoning 
the other. This problem was fixed.
