## Ticket Details
### Fix for building block definition input source selection
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
Depending on the chosen type the available input sources did not 
update accordingly. This is now fixed.

### Allow changes for building block multiplicity
**Audience:** Customer, Partner


#### Description
Previously it was impossible to later change the multiplicity of a building block
assignment from 'Multiple' to 'Once'. Now this setting can be changed at any time.
Please keep in mind that meshStack will not enforce any actions to existing building blocks
when a 'Multiple' building block gets changed to 'Once'.

### Tenants Column on Project Overview
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
We have added the tenants column back to the project overview in the admin area.

### Import Building Block Definitions From meshStack Hub
**Audience:** User


#### Description
You can now directly import building block definitions from our new meshStack Hub (hub.meshcloud.io) into your own meshStack. Simply open up a building block definition of choice, click "Add to meshStack", enter your meshStack URL and you will be redirected to import the building block definition.

### Mention Workspace Owner in Role Expiry Mail
**Audience:** User


#### Description
The workspace owner(s) are now mentioned in the mail when your workspace role is about to expire. 
This should make it easier to identify whom to contact in case you are a workspace member 
and need your role extended.

### Fix for landing zone role mappings
**Audience:** Customer


#### Description
This fixes a UI regression bug that broke the configuration of most platforms' role
mappings in landing zone configurations.

### New meshObject API endpoint for communications
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
The meshObject API in meshStack now provides new endpoints for meshCommunicationDefinitions and meshCommunications. Please be aware that these endpoints are still in a preview state and we will release the final endpoints in the upcoming weeks. More details on preview endpoints are described in the API documentation.

### meshTenantUsageReport v2 API based on Chargeback 2.0 data
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
The meshTenantUsageReport v2 API is now based on Chargeback 2.0 data. It still used data from
the old process before. No change to the result is expected. Please remember, that the meshTenantUsageReport
v2 API will be deprecated on Oct 1st 2025. Please switch your integrations to v3.

### Workspace Identifier in URL
**Audience:** User


#### Description
The workspace identifier is now part of the URL. This enables deeplinks to 
specific workspaces. You can now share links to specific workspaces 
with other users, making it easier for them to access the information 
they need.

### Improved admin area button visibility
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
The admin area button is now shown all the time to allow administrators to jump quickly
to the admin area dashboard.

### Platform Usage Reports with Chargeback 2.0
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
The platform usage reports shown in the admin area within the platform control plane are
now also based on Chargeback 2.0 data. You should not notice any difference in the reports.

### Allow movement of tenants with building blocks
**Audience:** Partner


#### Description
This fixes a bug that broke building blocks on a workspace if a tenant with building blocks
on it was moved into this workspace.
