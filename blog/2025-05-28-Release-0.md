## Ticket Details
### Fix Unpublished Definition Outputs not Editable
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
This fixes a bug that prevented editing the outputs of an unpublished building block definition.

### Fixed Changes on Building Block User Input
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This change ensures that when a user modifies their input editing permissions, those changes are saved correctly.
Previously, the system did not persist these changes, leading to confusion and frustration for users.

### Fixed breadcrumb service configuration
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
This change corrects the breadcrumb configuration for the tenant service configuration.
Previously, the breadcrumb was incorrectly set.

### Fix for "Add to Project" button in Marketplace
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Resolved an issue in the Marketplace view where the "Add to Project" button in the "three dots" menu
was not functioning correctly due to an incorrect router link. The button now navigates to the correct path.

### Keyboard Focus Support for Tag Tooltips
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Users can now navigate to shortened tag names in marketplace cards using the keyboard. 
When focused, the same tooltip that appears on mouse hover is shown. 
Users can also interact with the tooltip using the mouse and close it via the Esc key.

### Taggable Project Role
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We extended the project role to support tagging. You can now add tags on the project role create/update screen.
This is a prerequisite for supporting policies on ProjectRoles. Stay tuned for more updates.
