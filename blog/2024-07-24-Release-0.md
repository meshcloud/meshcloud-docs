## Ticket Details
### Performance Improvement when Loading Workspaces
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, we observed long loading times when loading a list of workspaces,
for example, when you have selected a platform in the Admin Area, then went
to Settings and then to Restrictions, loading the workspace dropdown could
take a while. This has been fixed.

### Adds missing tags for cloud platform replication
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This fix adds the tags related to the owner, additional owner and payment method amount
to the list of usable tags (it was already available in a drop-down when setting up the 
tags mapping in the admin area but they were non-functional).
This also includes updates to the documentation for those tags.
If you used the landing zone name or identifier as tags before (which also did not work 
and is fixed now) please correct the key in your platform configuration from 
tenantLandingZone (or tenantLandingZoneIdentifier) to the now correct ones: landingZoneName 
and landingZoneIdentifier.

### Improves mandatory building block checks at tenant creation
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
A bug allowed the creation of tenants without the mandatory landing zone building block
when a slow network connection was present.
The validation logic was fixed to prevent such incomplete creation requests from getting
accepted.

### Role Expiration Date Handling
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, it was possible to enter past dates to the workspace or project role expiration dates and only after adding the role, an 
error was shown. We now already show a validation error when a date from the past is chosen in the first place.

### Projects Default Quota Issue Resolved
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have identified and fixed an issue affecting meshStacks setup or project default quota modified since February 2024. This issue caused the 
defined projects default quota to not be applied correctly, defaulting Project quotas to 1 instead. With this release, the default 
quota will now be applied as intended.

### Prevent duplicate localIds of Service Instances
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
It was possible to create Service Instances with the same localId, if they belonged to different
Service Plans. As the OSB specification defines the localId as a globally unique ID, we now changed
this to make sure that the localIds are unique within a meshStack. This prevents potential issues
with Service Brokers that rely on localIds not only being unique within one service, but really 
globally.

### Improve messaging around required workspace role expirations
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Creating a new workspace requires at least one user with the workspace owner role.
If this role requires an expiration date to be set it will now be validated during workspace access assignment instead of leading to a technical error message during the actual workspace creation.

### Improve performance of project overview in admin area
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
In some environments the project overview in the admin area did load very slowly. This has been fixed
now and the page will load quickly.

### Fixed Expiration Date Issue in Workspace Access
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, while assigning a new user or group role in Workspace Access that required an expiration date, multiple incorrect 
requests are opened. In this release, this issue has been resolved. Also a tooltip has been added to remind users not to input 
dates in the past when assigning new user or group roles in workspace access.

### Streamlined Tenant Control Plane Navigation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have integrated items previously located in the sidebar of the "Overview" on the tenant control plane into a single, streamlined view. You will now immediately see the Console and the Building Blocks upon accessing the control plane, simplifying the workflow by making essential functionalities readily accessible. Additionally, in an upcoming release, we plan to remove the Console/CLI access buttons from the tenant overview on the project control plane, as they will now be instantly accessible.
