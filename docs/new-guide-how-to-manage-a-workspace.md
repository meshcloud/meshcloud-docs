## 5. Financials

- **Budgeting**: Set budgets or alerts to monitor spending and avoid overruns.
- **Cost allocation**: Use tags and project structure to allocate costs to teams, applications, or business units.

- **Connect platforms**: Link cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) to your workspace for resource provisioning.
- **Configure landing zones**: Set up landing zones for secure and compliant cloud environments.
