## Ticket Details
### Azure Cloud Functions freely available in private cloud
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
Azure Cloud Functions used in Landing Zones no longer need to be whitelisted when running in a private cloud environment without internet access.

### Resilient Service Broker handling in Metering
**Audience:** Operator


#### Description
Unavailable or broken metrics endpoints provided by service brokers no longer lead to all Marketplace
Usage Reports being delayed to the next Chargeback Statement.

#### How to use
Service Owners have to be aware, that if they don't provide metrics before the tenant usage reports are
finalized (which is usually four days after the end of the month),
this will result in those metrics not being fully considered in the Usage Reports and Chargeback Statements.
