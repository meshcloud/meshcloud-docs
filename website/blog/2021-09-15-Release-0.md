## Ticket Details
### Fixed filter when listing meshUsers in API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We've fixed a filtering issue for the meshUsers List endpoint where some users would not show up.
The endpoint now considers both meshUsers that are assigned directly to a meshProject and meshUsers that are
assigned via a meshCustomerUserGroup to a meshProject when filtering meshUsers by their meshProject.

### Fix duplicate users in user lookup due to case-sensitivity
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The Identity Lookup, when configured, will look up users from two sources: the meshStack database and the configured
enterprise user directory. If the two sources find a user with the same username or email, that user will be considered
the same user. This comparison of username and email used to be case-sensitive. We have changed that to be case-insensitive
because meshStack treats usernames and emails in a case-insensitive manner. This fixes the issue of duplicate users showing up in the identity lookup.

### Fixes issue in metrics based metering counters
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
There was an issue in metrics based metering counters which caused certain counts at the end of the month or start of
the month to be charged to the wrong month. This issue has been fixed and the counts will be charged to the correct
month from now on.

### Marketplace identifier on Service Broker Development page
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In the Service Broker Development page in the Account area of your meshCustomer, you can now see the marketplace
identifier alongside the marketplace name of the meshMarketplace to which a service broker has been published.
This helps to identify the marketplace identifier more easily for importing meshServiceInstances via the meshObject Import API.

### Fixed filter when listing meshUsers in API
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
We've fixed a filtering issue for the meshUsers List endpoint.
The endpoint now considers both, meshUsers that are assigned directly to a meshCustomer and meshUsers that are
assigned via a meshCustomerUserGroup to a meshCustomer, when filtering meshUsers by their meshCustomer.

### Drag and drop tags to change the order
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Tags can now be drag and dropped to change the order of meshTags in the Tag Editor. This order is applied to all
places where tags are shown, such as displaying tags of meshObjects and the tag overview in the Tag Editor.

### Refine meshTenant quota request count
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
The meshPanel dashboard shows a count of pending tenant quota requests that must be handled by platform operators.
This count has been refined so that pending requests on already deleted meshTenants will not be counted in. In
addition to that, the respective link will now directly navigate to the meshTenant overview screen with a preselection
applied, so that only meshTenants with pending quota requests are listed.

### Fix AWS Console Access via meshPanel with SSO
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We cleared out a bug that prevented users to access their AWS accounts via the meshPanel,
although the replication was successful and access was possible in general. This happened
only in case AWS SSO was configured for the respective accounts.
