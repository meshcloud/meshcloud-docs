## Ticket Details
### API to get Chargeback Statements and Usage Reports
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now get Chargeback Statements and Tenant Usage Reports via the meshObject API of meshMetering.
This will enable smooth integration into financial processes and enables Cloud Foundation teams to use 
this data in BI tools to build custom charts and dashboards.

#### How to use
Please contact <a href="mailto:support@meshcloud.io">meshcloud Support</a> to configure an API user for 
you to use these new APIs.
You will also get the API endpoint and link to the API docs from 
<a href="mailto:support@meshcloud.io">meshcloud Support</a>.

### Show username and customer role at the top right
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To make it clearer as to which user you are logged in as (and in which role) we added this information at the top right of the meshPanel.

### New chart look and feel
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To provide a better look and feel of charts in the meshPanel, we have introduced a new charting library. You can find the first migrated chart on the payment method details page, either in the meshCustomer area or in the Admin area.
