## Ticket Details
### Improved SSH key handling
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Addresses an issue that could cause failures when cloning repositories using SSH keys formatted for Windows.
Such SSH keys are now automatically formatted correctly. This change only applies to newly uploaded keys.

### File Inputs Overwrite Files for Terraform Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
File inputs now replace existing files in Terraform building blocks.
This can be useful in cases where the same Terraform module is used for multiple
building block definitions and part of the configuration must be adapted for each one (e.g. provider settings).

### Allow User Deletion for Non-SCIM Users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously all user deletion was disabled when user management was done via SCIM.
With this change, you can delete users again who are not managed via SCIM even if SCIM
is enabled.

### OSB Metrics-Based Metering Removed
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
The already announced deprecation of the OSB metrics-based metering was now applied and the
functionality is removed from the product.

### Broken API Keys and API Users Creation
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The creation of API keys and API users were 
broken within the last release. This is now resolved.

### Renaming for Workspace and Service Management
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The Workspace Management and Service Management areas have been renamed to better reflect their purpose. The new names are "Workspace 
Manager" and "Platform Builder," respectively. This change is intended to provide a clearer understanding of the functionality of these 
areas.

### Workspace Breadcrumbs
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
In this release, we introduce breadcrumb navigation to the workspace, enabling a clearer overview of your current location and 
faster access to previous levels in the hierarchy.
