---

[Building Blocks](administration.building-blocks.md) are the newest capability of meshStack to repetitively roll out infrastructure
by your workspace users. Building Blocks are considered the future of doing so, and this page explains the current gaps, and
pros and cons of using Building Blocks or the meshMarketplace.

The table below describes each capability and to what extent it is supported by the respective feature (Building Blocks or Marketplace)

‚úÖ - supported and works well

üü® - works to some extent

‚ùå - not supported at all
