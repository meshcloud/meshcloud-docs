title: How to Discover Shadow IT with Unmanaged Tenants
---

This guide explains how to use meshStack's unmanaged tenant discovery features to identify and address shadow ITâ€”cloud resources or accounts created outside of official processes.

## What is Shadow IT?
Shadow IT refers to cloud accounts, projects, or resources that are provisioned without central IT oversight. These unmanaged tenants can introduce security, compliance, and cost risks.

## How meshStack Helps Discover Shadow IT
meshStack can scan connected platforms for tenants (accounts, subscriptions, projects, namespaces, etc.) that are not yet managed within meshStack. These are called **unmanaged tenants**.

## Steps to Discover Unmanaged Tenants

1. **Access the Unmanaged Tenants View**
   - In meshPanel, navigate to the administration area or platform overview.
   - Look for a section labeled "Unmanaged Tenants" or similar.

2. **Review Discovered Tenants**
   - meshStack will list all detected tenants on connected platforms that are not yet managed.
   - Review details such as platform, tenant name, and creation date.

3. **Investigate and Take Action**
   - For each unmanaged tenant, determine if it is legitimate or a case of shadow IT.
   - Contact the owner or responsible team if possible.
   - Decide whether to onboard the tenant into meshStack for proper management, or take steps to decommission it if not needed.

4. **Onboard Legitimate Tenants**
   - Use meshStack's onboarding process to bring unmanaged tenants under central control.
   - Assign them to the correct workspace, project, and payment method.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review the list of unmanaged tenants to catch new shadow IT early.
- Establish clear policies for onboarding and managing all cloud resources.
- Communicate with teams about the risks of unmanaged cloud usage.
