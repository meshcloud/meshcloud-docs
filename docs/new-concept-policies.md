Policies in meshStack are rules that govern the behavior, configuration, and access of resources across the platform. They enable organizations to enforce security, compliance, and operational standards automatically. Policies can restrict actions, require specific tags, or ensure that resources meet defined criteria before provisioning or modification.

By using policies, administrators can automate governance, reduce manual oversight, and ensure consistent application of organizational requirements across all cloud environments managed by meshStack.
