## Ticket Details
### Building Block Costs for Cloud Foundry and OpenStack
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when setting a price for BB related to OpenStack or Cloud
Foundry, that price didn't appear in the chargeback statement. This issue has
now been resolved.

### Event Logs Show Correct Author for Tenant Deletion
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, when a Tenant was deleted by an application team member from a
Project, the corresponding Event Log entry showed incorrect email as the
author. This has been fixed, so that the actual username is shown instead.

### Service Instance Listing via API Key
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
You can now list your service instances using your API key. To enable this functionality, ensure that the permission "List service instances on workspace" is added to your API key under Workspace Access > API Keys.

### Fix Confirmation Dialog for Purging OSB Service Instances
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
When purging multiple OSB Service Instances, the confirmation dialog in meshPanel used
to keep information from the last purged instance. This issue has now been fixed.

### Recommended Services from the Landing Zone
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
With this update, application team members can now see recommended services for the landing zone selected.
The recommended services are presented as the last screen during the platform configuration process in Project 
or Tenant Creation. Recommended services can be referenced in the landing zone configuration by marking them 
"recommended".

### Deactivate platform types
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
You are now able to deactivate platform types in the Admin Area. This allows you to clean up platform types that you don't use anymore.

### Improved Tenant Replication execution
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, rare cases existed where a replication was executed even if a request encountered an issue. 
This has now been resolved, so replication will only be triggered for successful requests.

### Open Repository Link Button
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have added a new button to the Building Block definition Terraform implementation. This button allows 
users to open the provided repository link directly from the interface, enhancing ease of access to 
repository resources with a click. Please note that this feature currently works only for GitHub, GitLab, and 
BitBucket, and is limited to cloud-hosted solutions, not those that are self-hosted.

### Fix Workspace Column in Event Logs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Previously, there was a slight inconsistency in the Event Logs section within
the Admin Area for Platform Creation events. If the Platform was created
within the Admin Area, the Workspace column was not empty sometimes. This has
been fixed now.

### Fix Date Picker in Event Logs Section
**Audience:** Partner, Customer<br>

#### Description
For browsers that have been configured with non-German localization settings,
the date picker in the Event Logs section did not work correctly. This has
been fixed.

### Event Logs for Workspace Control Plane
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Recently, we have introduced the Event Logs page under the Compliance section in the Admin area. Now, you can find Event Logs also on the Workspace control plane under the Compliance section, so that teams can see all events related to their Workspace.

### Fix nested OUs for Control Tower enrollment
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
A bug prevented AWS accounts to get correctly enrolled in a nested Organizational
Unit. This has been fixed.

### Service Management Area is now opt-in
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Previously, when the service management area would be enabled on your meshStack, every single workspace manager would
see the "Service Management Area" button on the top-right of the workspace control plane. With this release, we now
made the availability of the Service Management Area an explicit opt-in before users see this button and area. Workspaces
that already offered one or more services from the Service Management Area automatically still have access.

#### How to use
In your workspace control plane go to "Settings -> General". Here you will find a new toggle where you can enable
the service management area for that particular workspace.

### Currency Conversion for Additional Currencies
**Audience:** Customer, Partner<br>

#### Description
The currency codes CAD, TWD, INR and CNY (i.e., Canadian Dollar, New Taiwan
Dollar, Indian Rupee and Yuan Renminbi) have been added to the currencies
that meshStack converts to EUR. Customers who are not using any cloud
provider that provides cost data in those currencies will not be impacted by
this change. Customers that do receive cost data with those currencies can
now have their cost data converted from those currencies to EUR.
Please contact meshcloud support for more details if you wish to convert
those currencies to EUR.
