## Ticket Details
### Improves tag replication for mixed replication settings
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
This improvement fixes a bug that led to the wrong replication values
when a tag was applied to a meshProject, meshWorkspace and a Payment Method
and had different replication settings applied.
It also adds checks and warnings if a tag is created that uses an tag key
which only differs in its case from already existing tags. This will now
lead to a conflict error message.

### Fix rare case where users could not be added to projects
**Audience:** User, Partner<br>

#### Description
On rare occasions, there could have been a database inconsistency that lead to errors when users
were added to projects. The cause for this inconsistency has been fixed.

### Filter Building Block List
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
The list of all Building Blocks in the Admin Area can now be filtered by all columns. That way you can
for example easily find all Building Blocks, that belong to a certain Building Block Definition.

### Improved performance of meshWorkspaceUserGroup API import
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When importing via the meshObject API a meshWorkspaceUserGroup with hundreds of members into a meshWorkspace
with hundreds of meshProjects, performance issues caused potential timeouts for those imports. The root causes
for the performance issues have been identified and fixes have been implemented. Therefore performance is
now significantly improved for this import. The timeout issues should not appear again.

### Fix Read-only Form Appearance
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
To provide a clear appearance of non-editable form fields, 
we have applied the gray background to input fields that are read-only.

### Increased limit of meshWorkspaces for users
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
If a user was assigned to more than 100 meshWorkspaces, only 100 meshWorkspaces were available
in the Navigation Bar at the top. This limit has been increased to 250 now.

### Fix for updating sensitive Building Block Definition inputs
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
When a Building Block Definition input was marked as sensitive and later
edited the value update was not properly handled, resulting in a broken
Building Block deployment. This has been fixed.

### Marketplace tenant deletion AAD group cleanup
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
When you use a marketplace replication that also sets up AAD user group for permissions purposes,
the deletion of the project and thus global marketplace will also cleanup and delete the created
AAD groups.

### Improves stability of deleting meshTenants
**Audience:** Operator<br>

#### Description
This fixes two bugs that could lead to stuck deleted tenants if the deleting replication failed.
The replication now also correctly re-tries tenant deleting replications that have failed.

### Fix Project Search in Workspaces Area
**Audience:** Partner, User, Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, on the Projects Overview page of a Workspaces Area, if you entered
a search term and there were no existing mesProjects that matched the search,
the search bar would disappear. Now, this issue has been resolved, and the
search input will always remain visible.

### Maintain OSB Dashboard client support with meshIdB
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
For meshStacks with an upgraded meshIdB (Keycloak v19.0.3), integrating with OSB dashboards
was broken. This is now fixed. Please note, however, that the OSB dashboard feature is deprecated.
As an alternative, we highly recommend using Azure Active Directory groups permission replication
through marketplace replication.
Visit our documentation to learn more: https://docs.meshcloud.io/docs/meshstack.meshmarketplace.index.html#aad-permission-replication.
If this option does not work, we recommend using the meshObject API to get Authorization information out of meshStack and into your desired system.

### Fix running replication indicator in Tenant Details
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
When you triggered the replication in the past, the indicator badge at the top in the Tenant Details always showed "Replication is running..." even though the rest of the page showed the finished replication results. This has been fixed.

### Renaming Customer Roles to Workspace Roles
**Audience:** User, Customer, Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
To maintain consistency with the renaming of meshCustomer to meshWorkspace, we have also renamed the roles. So that, the 'Customer Owner' role is now called 'Workspace Owner', 'Customer Admin' is now referred to as 'Workspace Manager', and 'Customer Employee' is now 'Workspace Member'.

### Building Blocks Overview
**Audience:** Partner, Operator<br>

#### Description
You can now find an overview of all Building Blocks across all meshWorkspaces under Building Blocks in the Admin Area.
