## Ticket Details
### Disable Landing Zone edits
**Audience:** Partner<br>

#### Description
Changing some values of an existing Landing Zone could have resulted in unintended modification of the meshTenant.
To prevent these kind of problems, most fields of the Landing Zones are now marked as read-only if an existing one is edited by a Partner.

### Fix polling of Service Instance status
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** meshfed


#### Description
Recently there was an issue when a service instance in the meshMarketplace was in status "in progress".
The UI showed "TypeError: t is undefined". This issue has been fixed.

### Unshare Service Instance
**Audience:** User<br>**Component:** release-note


#### Description
Service Instance Sharing is now revokable. The target project as well as the owning project can revoke the instance sharing.
