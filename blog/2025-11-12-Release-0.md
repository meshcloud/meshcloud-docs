## Ticket Details
### Fix for User Deletion and Binding Removal
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We resolved an issue that would occasionally prevent user deletion and
the removal of user bindings to a workspace with an error message t
hat the user could not be found.

### Permissions for Workspace User Groups API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We added dedicated permissions to read workspace user groups via the meshObject API.
These permissions can be added to API keys as usual.

### Comprehensive Documentation for meshPlatform API Request and Response Fields
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
All request and response fields for the meshPlatform API are now fully documented. This includes detailed
descriptions for all configuration options across supported platform types (AWS, Azure, GCP, AKS, Kubernetes,
OpenShift, and Azure Resource Groups).
The API documentation now provides complete examples for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each
supported platform type.

### Fixed Frozen Loading Spinners on Systems with Reduced Motion Enabled
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where loading spinners appeared frozen (not rotating) for users who had "Reduce motion"
enabled in their operating system accessibility settings. This affected users on macOS, Windows, and other
operating systems who use this accessibility feature. The spinners are now displayed correctly and rotate
properly regardless of the system's motion preference settings.

### New Dedicated Page for Building Block Runners
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
A new "Runners" tab has been added to the building blocks section. This dedicated page provides a
centralized overview of all building block runners in your meshStack installation, including both shared and
self-hosted runners. You can now view runner details, filter by implementation type and manage runners from a single location.

### Fixed Payment Method Links for Users Without Edit Permissions
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where payment method links in the admin area projects overview were clickable even when users lacked the 
necessary permissions to edit them. These links are now properly disabled when you don't have payment method edit 
permissions, preventing confusion and ensuring you can only access features you're authorized to use.

### New meshEventLog Endpoint in meshObject API
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We introduced a new meshEventLog endpoint in the meshObject API that allows you to retrieve event logs programmatically.
This enables you to integrate event log data into your automation workflows and monitoring systems. Notice that the meshEventLog
API is still in a preview version and may be subject to changes.

### Simplified user invites
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We have simplified the user invitation process by replacing 
the previous "manual user invites" feature with the new
"invitation tokens" completely. All existing meshStacks 
that were using manual user invites have been automatically 
migrated to use the new invitation tokens functionality. 
This change does not affect meshStacks that use SCIM.
