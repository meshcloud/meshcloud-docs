## Ticket Details
### Manual Building Block Step Update Fix
**Audience:** Customer<br>

#### Description
Previously, the step status for the Manual Building Block was not updated correctly, despite the successful completion of the Building Block. This issue is now resolved and the step status is updated after the successful execution.

### Fix for Terraform Building Blocks Source Checkout
**Audience:** User, Operator<br>

#### Description
We resolved a bug affecting Terraform Building Blocks where the specified git refName 
in the Building Block Definition was not properly respected during execution. 
Previously, this caused sources to always be checked out from the latest state on the default branch, 
rather than the intended reference. With this fix, the correct git refName is now correctly considered, 
ensuring that the specified branch, tag, or commit is accurately used when checking out the source.

### Fix live logs for Terraform Building Blocks
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Logs for steps of a Terraform Building Block Run are now updated
live again instead of only at the end of each step.
