## Ticket Details
### Building Block Definitions Filter Results Improvement
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The building block definitions overview page now shows proper message in the table when applied 
filters don't match any definitions, instead of showing the empty state. This provides clearer 
feedback that definitions exist but are filtered out.

### Fix Rare Race Condition in Tenant Replication
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where a race condition could occur during tenant replication. In very rare cases, when a new tenant
replication was triggered while a retry of a previous replication was still running, the newer replication failed
but was never retried. This could lead to tenants remaining in the failed state until the nightly replication.
Tenant replications will now be handled correctly even when multiple replication attempts overlap, ensuring that 
the most recent replication request is always processed.

### Improved Workspace Role Expiration Alert Modal
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
The workspace role expiration alert modal has been enhanced with a better layout and clearer navigation. 
The modal now displays workspace expiration information in a more structured format with direct "Go to 
Workspace" buttons for each workspace, making it easier to extend or modify access permissions.

### Fix Authentication in OpenStack With Custom Configuration
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where OpenStack authentication would fail when configuring a custom project or domain. 
The platform now correctly uses the configured domain and project values for authentication.

### View Runner assigned to Building Block Definition
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
Platform engineers can now see which runner is associated with a building block definition version in the "Implementation"
tab of the building block definition. This information enables you to access the workload identity federation information
for that runner.

#### How to use
Navigate to a building block definition implementation in the platform builder or admin area to see its associated runner. 
Changing the runner assignment is not yet supported but will be available in a future update.

### Prevent Stuck Building Block Upgrades
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We fixed an issue where building block upgrades could get stuck when you triggered an upgrade while a 
building block run was still in progress. Now we prevent you from upgrading a building block if its 
current run hasn't finished yet, ensuring your upgrades complete successfully.

### Improved meshPlatform API Validation for Publication Status
**Audience:** User<br>

#### Description
We improved validation for the meshPlatform API to ensure that when you create a meshPlatform, it must be in a
publication status of either PUBLISHED or UNPUBLISHED. If you attempt to create a meshPlatform with an invalid
publication status, the API now returns a clear and meaningful error message explaining the requirement. This helps
prevent configuration errors and provides better guidance when working with the meshPlatform API programmatically.
